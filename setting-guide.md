## What is Eberron?

Eberron is a fantasy setting that blends traditional medieval fantasy with pulp adventure, noir intrigue, and magical technology. Created by Keith Baker, the setting draws inspiration from films like *Raiders of the Lost Ark*, *Casablanca*, *The Maltese Falcon*, and *Pirates of the Caribbean*.

The world feels like a fantasy version of the 1920s-1930s—a post-war society with airships, trains, and widespread low-level magic integrated into everyday life. Some fans describe it as "dungeonpunk."

## Core Themes and Tone

### Moral Ambiguity

Unlike settings with clear-cut good versus evil, Eberron thrives in shades of grey. Heroes aren't always noble, and villains may have sympathetic motivations. A silver dragon might be corrupt while a vampire could be an ally. This makes Eberron ideal for mysteries, political intrigue, and morally complex stories.

### The Aftermath of War

The setting takes place two years after the Last War—a century-long conflict that devastated the continent. The tone mirrors post-World War I Europe: veterans uncertain of their place, nations in uneasy peace, espionage and political tension simmering beneath the surface. Old grudges remain fresh, and another war feels inevitable.

### Wide Magic

Magic in Eberron is widespread but not high-powered. Ordinary people use minor magic daily—magical streetlights illuminate cities, speaking stones allow long-distance communication, and elemental-powered trains connect nations. However, powerful magic remains rare. A village might have someone who can mend a broken tool, but finding someone who can raise the dead is exceptionally difficult.

### Cinematic Action

Eberron encourages swashbuckling, dramatic action. Chases through vertical cities, battles atop speeding lightning rails, and desperate escapes from ancient ruins are the norm. Think pulp adventure serials and noir detective stories.

## The World

### The Progenitor Dragons

According to myth, three dragon gods created the world:

- **Siberys** (the Dragon Above) — became the ring of golden dragonshards orbiting the world and is associated with the heavens
- **Eberron** (the Dragon Between) — became the world itself, the land and sea
- **Khyber** (the Dragon Below) — became the underworld, imprisoned within Eberron's depths

### The Continent of Khorvaire

Most adventures take place on Khorvaire, the most "civilized" continent. Once united under the Kingdom of Galifar, it shattered into warring nations a century ago.

## The Five Nations

The heart of Khorvaire consists of five nations, each with a distinct character:

### Aundair

A nation of knowledge and magic. Aundair values education, arcane study, and sophistication. Its people are often seen as intellectual but sometimes extravagant or arrogant. The floating towers of Arcanix house one of the finest magical academies in the world.

### Breland

The most progressive and diverse nation, home to the massive city of Sharn. Breland values innovation, commerce, and individual freedom. Its people have a reputation for being clever and pragmatic—sometimes to the point of seeming shady or opportunistic.

### Karrnath

A militaristic nation that values discipline, strength, and martial tradition. Karrnath suffered greatly during the Last War and controversially employed undead soldiers. Its people are seen as tough and stoic, but the nation carries a dark reputation.

### Thrane

A theocracy devoted to the Church of the Silver Flame. Thrane values faith, righteousness, and the battle against supernatural evil. Its people can be seen as devout and steadfast—or as zealous and judgmental.

### Cyre (The Mournland)

Once considered the jewel of Galifar, Cyre no longer exists. On the Day of Mourning—four years ago—a catastrophic magical event destroyed the entire nation in moments. No one knows what caused it. The Treaty of Thronehold ended the Last War two years later, leaving Cyre's destruction as the conflict's most terrible mystery.

What remains is the Mournland—a blasted, twisted wasteland where the dead don't decay, living spells roam wild, and reality itself seems broken. The Mournland serves as both a mystery at the heart of the setting and a constant reminder of how devastating magical warfare can be.

## Other Notable Regions

- **Droaam** — A nation of monsters (medusas, harpies, ogres) who have organized under the rule of three hag sisters
- **The Eldeen Reaches** — Wilderness protected by druidic sects
- **Darguun** — A goblin nation carved out during the chaos of the Last War
- **The Talenta Plains** — Home to halflings who ride dinosaurs and maintain a nomadic culture
- **Q'barra** — A frontier land with a "wild west" feel, where settlers clash with lizardfolk and ancient secrets
- **The Lhazaar Principalities** — Island nations of pirates, privateers, and merchant princes
- **Xen'drik** — A mysterious southern continent, home to ruins of an ancient giant civilization and dangerous secrets

## Sharn: The City of Towers

![Sharn, the City of Towers]({{ '/images/sharn-city-of-towers.png' | relative_url }})

Sharn is the largest city in Khorvaire and often serves as a campaign's home base. Built on a manifest zone that enhances flight magic, the city rises nearly a mile into the sky—towers stacked upon towers, connected by bridges and served by flying transports.

Sharn is a city of extremes. In the highest spires, dragonmarked barons make deals in crystal towers. In the depths below, criminals rule lightless slums. It's a perfect setting for noir intrigue, with corruption at every level of society.

## Transportation

Khorvaire is connected by a network of magical transportation that makes the continent feel smaller than its size suggests. Two dragonmarked houses dominate travel: House Orien controls ground transportation, while House Lyrandar rules the skies and seas.

### The Lightning Rail

![The lightning rail races across Khorvaire]({{ '/images/lightning-rail.png' | relative_url }})

House Orien's lightning rail is the backbone of Khorvairian travel. These elegant trains don't run on tracks—they glide above a path of conductor stones, crackling with bound elemental energy. The rail connects all the major cities of the Five Nations (except the Mournland, where the lines were severed by the Day of Mourning).

Travel by lightning rail is fast, comfortable, and relatively safe. First-class passengers enjoy private cabins, dining cars, and observation lounges. Steerage is cramped but affordable. The journey from Sharn to Wroat takes about a day; crossing the continent takes several.

The lightning rail is also a classic adventure location—murder mysteries, heists, and dramatic confrontations all work beautifully on a train racing through the countryside.

### Airships

House Lyrandar's airships are the most dramatic symbol of Eberron's magical technology. These vessels are wooden ships held aloft by bound elementals—rings of fire or air that encircle the hull and carry it through the sky. A Lyrandar heir with the Mark of Storm pilots the ship by communing with the elemental.

Airship travel is faster than the lightning rail but far more expensive—only the wealthy, the desperate, or those on House business typically fly. Airships also serve military and cargo purposes, and some independent captains operate outside House control (often as smugglers or privateers).

### Other Transportation

- **Skycoaches**: In Sharn, smaller flying vehicles serve as taxis, carrying passengers between towers
- **Magebred horses**: House Vadalis breeds superior mounts—faster, stronger, and more intelligent than normal horses
- **Elemental galleons**: House Lyrandar also operates ships with bound water elementals for sea travel
- **Orien couriers**: For messages and small packages, House Orien's couriers use teleportation magic
- **House Sivis message stations**: Speaking stones allow long-distance communication, like magical telegraph offices

### Transportation and Adventure

The contrast between magical convenience and frontier danger defines Eberron travel. Within the Five Nations, you can cross the continent in days. But step off the lightning rail into the Eldeen Reaches, venture into Droaam, or try to cross the Mournland—and suddenly civilization feels very far away.

Transportation itself often becomes the adventure. Chases across Sharn's vertical cityscape, intrigue aboard a lightning rail, desperate repairs on a failing airship—these are classic Eberron scenarios.

## The Dragonmarked Houses

Thirteen bloodlines carry dragonmarks—magical sigils that grant supernatural abilities. These families have leveraged their marks into economic empires that transcend national boundaries. The Houses remained neutral during the Last War, selling services to all sides.

### The Major Houses

- **House Cannith** (Mark of Making) — Artificers and manufacturers who created the warforged and helped build the lightning rail
- **House Deneith** (Mark of Sentinel) — Mercenaries and bodyguards; the only House permitted to maintain an army
- **House Jorasco** (Mark of Healing) — Healers who run hospitals and sell medical services
- **House Ghallanda** (Mark of Hospitality) — Innkeepers and hosts who guarantee safe lodging
- **House Phiarlan** (Mark of Shadow) — Entertainers publicly, spies and information brokers privately
- **House Thuranni** (Mark of Shadow) — Split from Phiarlan; focused on espionage and assassination
- **House Lyrandar** (Mark of Storm) — Control weather magic and operate airships
- **House Orien** (Mark of Passage) — Run the lightning rail and courier services
- **House Sivis** (Mark of Scribing) — Handle communication, translation, and legal documentation
- **House Kundarak** (Mark of Warding) — Bankers and security specialists; run the safest vaults in the world
- **House Medani** (Mark of Detection) — Investigators and bodyguards who specialize in threat detection
- **House Tharashk** (Mark of Finding) — Bounty hunters, trackers, and dragonshard prospectors
- **House Vadalis** (Mark of Handling) — Animal breeders who produce magebred creatures

### House Politics

The Korth Edicts (laws from the old kingdom) prevent Houses from owning land or holding noble titles, keeping them theoretically separate from political power. In practice, the Houses grow more influential as the nations remain divided. Some whisper that if Khorvaire is ever reunited, it may be under a dragonmarked heir rather than a royal one.

## Unique Peoples of Eberron

### Warforged

Living constructs created by House Cannith as soldiers during the Last War. Made of wood, metal, and stone animated by magic, warforged are sentient beings who must now find purpose in a world at peace. Many struggle with questions of identity: Were they built for war alone? Do they have souls? What does freedom mean for a created being?

### Changelings

Descendants of doppelgangers, changelings can shift their appearance at will. Many create multiple personas with distinct identities, names, and lives. They face prejudice from those who distrust shapeshifters, leading many to hide their true nature.

### Shifters

Called "weretouched," shifters descended from humans and lycanthropes. They can briefly shift to a more bestial form, gaining enhanced abilities. Shifters often live on society's edges and maintain tight-knit communities.

### Kalashtar

Humans bonded with spirits from the plane of dreams. Kalashtar possess innate psychic abilities and wage a secret war against the Dreaming Dark—sinister entities that manipulate mortals through nightmares. They appear human but carry ancient spirits within them.

## Religion in Eberron

Religion in Eberron is a matter of faith, not certainty. The gods have never walked the world, and no one can prove they exist—yet divine magic works, and the faithful find meaning in their beliefs.

### The Sovereign Host

The dominant religion of Khorvaire, the Sovereign Host consists of nine deities representing aspects of civilization and daily life. Most followers (called Vassals) worship the pantheon as a whole rather than individual gods. It's a practical, everyday faith woven into common life.

### The Dark Six

Six gods cast out from the Sovereign Host, representing darker aspects of existence: destruction, decay, passion, and treachery. While considered evil by mainstream society, some worship them openly or in secret.

### The Silver Flame

A younger faith centered on a divine force that protects the world from supernatural evil. The Church of the Silver Flame is highly organized, with its seat of power in Thrane. Followers seek to destroy evil (especially undead and fiends) and protect the innocent. The church has noble ideals but, like any institution, contains corruption and zealotry alongside genuine faith.

### The Blood of Vol

A faith focused on the divinity within—the belief that the true divine spark lies in the blood and that mortals should seek their own path to immortality rather than worship distant gods. Outsiders often view the faith with suspicion due to its association with undead, but most followers are simply people seeking meaning and self-determination. (Unknown to most worshipers, the faith is secretly manipulated by an ancient lich.)

### Other Faiths

- **The Path of Light** — The kalashtar philosophy focused on positive spiritual transformation
- **The Cults of the Dragon Below** — Dangerous cults worshiping dark powers in Khyber
- **The Undying Court** — Elven ancestor worship centered on preserved undead elders

## The Planes and Manifest Zones

Eberron has its own cosmology of thirteen planes that orbit the material world. Unlike other settings, these planes wax and wane in influence, sometimes drawing close (coterminous) and sometimes pulling away (remote).

**Manifest zones** are places where a plane's influence bleeds into the material world permanently. Sharn sits on a manifest zone connected to Syrania (the Azure Sky), which is why its towers can reach such impossible heights. A manifest zone to Dolurrh (the realm of the dead) might cause ghosts to linger, while one connected to Lamannia (the Twilight Forest) might cause plants to grow wild and enhance nature magic.

### Notable Planes

- **Dal Quor** (Region of Dreams) — Where mortals go when they dream; home to the sinister quori
- **Dolurrh** (Realm of the Dead) — A grey realm where spirits fade
- **Fernia** (Sea of Fire) — An elemental plane of flame
- **Thelanis** (Faerie Court) — Realm of fey and stories
- **Xoriat** (Realm of Madness) — Home to aberrations and alien horrors
- **Mabar** (Endless Night) — Plane of darkness and entropy
- **Irian** (Eternal Day) — Plane of light and positive energy

## For Game Masters

### Embrace the Tone

Eberron works best when you lean into its themes. Make things morally complex—the patron who hires the party might have questionable motives. Add intrigue—there's always someone watching, always a deeper conspiracy. Use cinematic setpieces—fights on moving trains, chases through the vertical city, confrontations in ancient ruins.

### Everything Has a Place

The guiding principle of Eberron is: "If it exists in D&D, it has a place in Eberron." Monsters aren't random encounters—they're members of organizations, citizens of nations, or pieces of larger schemes. Those goblins aren't just goblins; they're Darguun soldiers or Daask enforcers. That dragon isn't guarding a random hoard; it might be a member of the Chamber, manipulating events for its own mysterious purposes.

### The Last War Matters

The war shapes everything. NPCs are veterans carrying trauma. Nations eye each other with suspicion. Refugees have lost everything. War profiteers got rich while others suffered. Use the war as backdrop—it provides endless story hooks and emotional stakes.

### Mystery is Central

Eberron is full of mysteries without canon answers: What caused the Mourning? Do the gods exist? What is the Draconic Prophecy really about? These mysteries are features, not bugs. You can provide answers in your campaign, but the setting works because the answers remain uncertain.

## For Players

### Your Character in a Changed World

Consider how your character relates to the Last War. Did they fight? Lose loved ones? Profit from it? Are they a refugee from Cyre with nowhere to call home? A warforged struggling to find purpose after being built for a war that ended? A veteran haunted by what they did?

### Nations Over Races

In Eberron, national and cultural identity often matters more than species. A dwarf from Karrnath has more in common with their human neighbors than with dwarves from the Mror Holds. Consider where your character is from and what that means to them.

### Everyone Has an Angle

Trust carefully. Patrons have hidden agendas. Organizations pursue their own goals. Even allies may be working toward ends that don't align with yours. This isn't meant to make you paranoid—it's an invitation to engage with the intrigue.

### Magic is Everyday

Your character lives in a world where minor magic is commonplace. You've ridden lightning rails, seen skycoaches, and used speaking stones. Magic isn't mysterious to your character—it's just how the world works. What's remarkable in Eberron is the *powerful* magic, not the everyday kind.
