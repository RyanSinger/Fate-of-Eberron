<p><em>A Fate Core adaptation for pulp noir adventure in the world of Eberron</em></p>

## What is This?

Fate of Eberron combines the narrative flexibility of **Fate Core** with the setting of **Eberron**—a world of noir intrigue, magical technology, and moral complexity.

This adaptation uses mode-based character creation inspired by *Atomic Robo RPG*, letting you quickly build characters that feel authentically Eberron while embracing Fate's fiction-first approach.
