A guide to running Eberron campaigns using the Fate system.

This document works alongside the **Eberron Setting Guide** (for world lore) and the **Player's Guide** (for character creation).

## Running Eberron

Eberron has a distinctive tone that sets it apart from traditional fantasy. Your job as GM is to embody that tone in play.

### The Core Principles

**Everything Is Morally Complicated**

There are no pure heroes or irredeemable villains in Eberron. The Silver Flame church genuinely fights evil—and also conducted a purge that nearly wiped out lycanthropes and shifters. House Cannith created the warforged, giving rise to a new form of life—and did so to profit from a century of war. The Lord of Blades may be a terrorist, or may be the only one fighting for warforged liberation.

When you create NPCs, give them understandable motivations. When you present factions, show their virtues alongside their flaws. When players make choices, let those choices have real consequences—but not simple ones.

> *Don't tell the players that the Church of the Silver Flame is good or evil. Show them a Thrane priest who heals the sick for free—and then show them another who treats shifters with barely concealed disgust. Let players form their own opinions.*

**The War Isn't Over**

The Last War ended with the Treaty of Thronehold, but a hundred years of conflict don't just evaporate. Every adult in Khorvaire remembers the war. Many fought in it. Refugees from Cyre have no home to return to. Veterans carry physical and mental scars. The nations watch each other across borders, waiting for the next betrayal.

Use the war as background texture constantly:
- NPCs mention relatives lost in the war
- Buildings bear damage from battles fought years ago
- Political tensions flare when characters of different nationalities interact
- Warforged face discrimination from those who see them as weapons, not people
- Cyran refugees are everywhere, stateless and bitter

**Intrigue and Conspiracy**

Nothing in Eberron is what it seems on the surface. Every organization has secrets. Every powerful figure has hidden agendas. Conspiracies nest inside conspiracies.

The Aurum manipulates commerce and politics. The Dreaming Dark infiltrates through dreams. The Lords of Dust have plans spanning millennia. The Chamber's dragons pursue the Draconic Prophecy through proxies. The dragonmarked houses pursue their own interests across national borders.

Build layers into your mysteries. When players solve one conspiracy, they should glimpse another beneath it. Not everything needs an answer—some mysteries should remain mysteries.

**Cinematic Action**

Eberron is pulp adventure, not gritty realism. Fights happen on lightning rails racing through the Mournland. Chases unfold across Sharn's vertical cityscape. Ancient ruins contain elaborate traps and awakening horrors.

Push for dynamic locations and dramatic situations:
- "You're fighting on a rain-slick bridge between two towers, five hundred feet above Lower Dura."
- "The train lurches as something massive strikes it from beneath the track."
- "The ritual circle flares with light. You have until the moons align—maybe five minutes."

Use zones aggressively. Create environmental hazards. Let players destroy the scenery. Embrace the chaos.

**Put a Scene On It**

Never resolve actions abstractly. Before any roll, establish the scene: When is this happening? Where? Who else is present? What could go wrong?

A player wants to modify their airship. Don't just say "roll Crafts." Ask: "When are you doing this—at night when no one can see, or openly at the dock? What do the House Lyrandar dockworkers think of you messing with their vessel?" Suddenly there's potential for complications, witnesses, or allies.

Apply the **TV Test**: If your game were a TV show, would this scene make the cut? If a player says "I want to research the Dhakaani Empire," that's not a scene—that's a montage at best. Instead: "You're in Morgrave's restricted archives at midnight. The librarian who let you in is nervous—she could lose her job. What are you looking for, and what happens if someone catches you?" Now it's a scene.

**Ask "What Does Success Look Like?"**

Before dice hit the table, ask the player what they're hoping to achieve. "I attack him" tells you nothing. "I want to disarm him and back him against the railing so he'll talk" tells you everything. Now you know what success means—and what interesting failure might look like.

This also helps players think cinematically. They stop optimizing dice rolls and start directing their character's story.

---

## Your Fate Points

As GM, you have your own pool of fate points to use for NPCs.

**Starting Each Scene**: You begin each scene with fate points equal to the number of PCs. If a major NPC or boss previously conceded a conflict, or if the PCs invoked aspects against them in earlier scenes, add those fate points to your pool. Unspent fate points from compels in the previous scene also carry over.

**Spending Fate Points**: You spend fate points to invoke aspects for NPCs, refuse compels on NPCs, or activate NPC stunts that require spending. This works just like it does for players.

**Compels Are Free**: You don't need to spend fate points to compel PC aspects—you have an unlimited supply for that purpose. Compels generate story and give players fate points. Use them liberally.

**Earning Fate Points**: When PCs invoke aspects against your NPCs, when NPCs concede conflicts, or when certain stunts trigger, fate points flow to your reserve.

> *In practice, don't stress too much about tracking this precisely. The goal is to ensure NPCs can invoke aspects when dramatically appropriate, while keeping compels flowing freely. If you're unsure, err on the side of letting the NPCs be competent—but not at the cost of fun.*

---

## Setting Difficulty and Opposition

When players roll against passive opposition, you set the difficulty. Here's a simple framework:

**Difficulty Guidelines:**
- **Low (Fair +2)**: Routine tasks for a competent person. Anyone with relevant training should succeed most of the time.
- **Moderate (Good +3)**: Requires real effort or expertise. Failure is plausible even for skilled characters.
- **High (Great +4)**: Challenging even for experts. Success requires both skill and luck.
- **Extreme (Superb +5 or higher)**: Legendary difficulty. Most characters need to invoke aspects to succeed.

**Start at +2 and adjust.** Most difficulties should be Fair (+2). Raise it if:
- The task is inherently difficult
- Circumstances work against the character (but consider making this an aspect instead)
- Success should feel like an accomplishment

**Use aspects instead of difficulty bumps.** If the situation has a complication, make it an aspect rather than adding +2 to difficulty. *Slippery Floor* is more interesting than "the floor is slippery, so +2 to the difficulty." Aspects can be invoked, compelled, and addressed.

**Active opposition is usually better.** When someone or something actively resists, have them roll instead of setting a static number. It's more dynamic and gives you something to invoke.

---

## Session Zero

Before your first adventure, run a **session zero**—a conversation about expectations, character creation, and campaign setup. This session is as important as any adventure.

### What to Cover

**Campaign Pitch**: Share your vision for the campaign. Are you running a noir mystery in Sharn? A wilderness expedition to Xen'drik? A war story along the Karrnathi border? Give players enough to create fitting characters.

**Tone and Content**: Eberron supports many tones—pulpy action, political intrigue, horror, war stories. Discuss which elements will feature prominently in your game. This is also when you establish safety tools (see below).

**Party Connection**: Characters need a reason to work together. Consider:
- A shared patron (dragonmarked house, university, government agency)
- A common enemy (Emerald Claw, crime syndicate, rival corporation)
- A shared past (same unit in the war, same school, same street)
- A business venture (inquisitive agency, salvage company, courier service)

**Character Creation**: Build characters together. When players see each other's aspects, they can build connections. "Oh, you're a Cyran refugee? My character blames Cyre for the war—that's interesting tension."

### Questions to Ask Players

- What does your character want? (Drives adventures)
- What does your character fear? (Drives drama)
- Who does your character trust? (Potential allies or complications)
- What's your character's relationship to the Last War?
- How did you meet another PC?

### The First Session

End session zero with a brief opening scene—not combat, just roleplay. Let characters introduce themselves in action:
- Meeting at a tavern to discuss a job
- Arriving at a crime scene together
- Receiving orders from their patron

This grounds the campaign before the "real" adventure begins.

---

## Safety Tools

Eberron's themes include war, moral ambiguity, and dark conspiracies. Before play, establish boundaries with your group.

**The X-Card**: Place an index card with an "X" on the table. Any player can tap it to indicate that content has crossed a line—no explanation required. When someone uses it, edit, rewind, or skip the content.

**Script Change**: Borrow from theater. Players can call:
- **Pause**: Stop and discuss what's happening
- **Rewind**: Replay a scene differently
- **Fast-Forward**: Skip past uncomfortable content
- **Resume**: Continue when ready

**Lines and Veils**: Discuss before play:
- **Lines**: Content that won't appear in the game at all
- **Veils**: Content that can exist but happens "off-screen"

Common topics to discuss: torture, violence against children, mind control and possession, slavery (common in some Eberron cultures), graphic violence, romantic or sexual content.

**Use these tools.** Eberron works best when everyone feels safe to engage with its darker themes. Safety tools let you explore moral complexity without causing real harm.

---

## Scale

Eberron features dramatic power differentials—ancient dragons, daelkyr, and overlords operate on a completely different level than mortal adventurers. **Scale** is a tool for modeling this in your NPC designs.

Scale isn't something PCs have or earn. It's purely a GM tool for creating adversaries whose power transcends normal skill ratings.

### Scale Levels

| Scale | Eberron Examples |
|-------|------------------|
| Mundane | Commoners, magewrights, typical guards |
| Supernatural | Experienced adventurers, young dragons, lesser fiends |
| Otherworldly | Adult dragons, rakshasa, daelkyr lieutenants |
| Legendary | Ancient dragons, daelkyr, the Undying Court |
| Godlike | Overlords, the Voice of Siberys, Lady Illmarrow at full power |

### Using Scale

When an NPC has scale above Mundane, they gain **one benefit per level of difference** when acting against Mundane opponents:

- **+1 before rolling** (representing raw superiority)
- **+2 after rolling** if already successful (representing overwhelming force)
- **One additional free invoke** when creating advantages (representing tactical dominance)

Choose the same benefit multiple times or mix them. A Legendary dragon (3 steps above Mundane) might take +3 before rolling, or +1 before and +2 after, or any combination.

### Scale in Practice

**Scale makes certain fights unwinnable through direct confrontation.** That's intentional. If the PCs pick a straight fight with an overlord, they should lose. Scale models the narrative truth that some enemies require preparation, artifacts, clever plans, or dramatic sacrifice to defeat.

**Use scale sparingly.** Most adversaries—even powerful ones—don't need it. A crime lord, a corrupt noble, or even a mid-level dragon can be modeled with high skills and good stunts. Reserve scale for truly mythic entities.

**Scale can be situational.** A dragon is Legendary in physical combat but might be merely Supernatural in a battle of wits. An overlord is Godlike when manifested but perhaps only Otherworldly when working through agents.

**Scale can be neutralized.** The *Silver Flame* might grant temporary scale against fiends. An artifact forged in the Prophecy might let mortals fight a dragon as equals. Discovering how to neutralize an enemy's scale advantage can be an entire adventure arc.

> **Example**: The party confronts Mordakhesh the Shadowsword, a rakshasa prakhutu (Otherworldly—2 steps above Mundane). In combat, he takes +2 before every roll. The PCs' best fighter has Great (+4) Fight, but Mordakhesh's Good (+3) effectively becomes Superb (+5).
>
> Direct combat is suicidal. The party needs another approach: finding his true name, securing a Khyber dragonshard that binds him, or calling in a favor from the Chamber.

---

## Building Adversaries

There are two approaches to creating NPCs:

**Quick NPCs**: For characters who appear once or aren't meant to be major obstacles, keep it simple:
- Give them one aspect (their concept)
- One or two skills at +1 to +3
- No stress track—one hit takes them out, or they concede

**Detailed NPCs**: For recurring characters, major villains, or anyone who needs to last multiple scenes, use the adversary framework below.

The Fate Adversary Toolkit provides a framework for building opposition based on narrative role rather than power level. Choose adversary types based on the story function you need.

### Adversary Types

#### Threats

Threats exist to be hit once and go down. They're dangerous in numbers but not individually durable. Use them to create chaos and drain resources.

**Building Threats:**
- One aspect (their concept: *Daask Street Thug*, *Emerald Claw Initiate*)
- One or two skills at Average (+1) or Fair (+2)
- No stress track—any successful hit takes them out
- Attack in groups using teamwork (+1 per additional threat, max +3)

**When to use:** Swarms of enemies, dangerous-but-fragile minions, time pressure through numbers.

> **Example: Boromar Thugs**
> *Halfling Street Muscle*
> Skills: Fight Average (+1), Notice Average (+1)
> A group of 4 attacks at Fair (+2). Each hit removes one thug.

#### Fillers

Fillers are grouped enemies that share a stress track. They're tougher than threats but still exist to be mowed down.

**Building Fillers:**
- One aspect for the group
- One or two skills at Fair (+2) or Good (+3)
- Shared stress track (1 box per member)
- Attack as one unit with teamwork bonus
- Removing stress removes individuals from the fight

**When to use:** Guards, cultists, mercenary squads—opposition that should feel substantial but not individually memorable.

> **Example: Emerald Claw Squad (4 soldiers)**
> *Vol's Faithful Servants*
> Skills: Fight Fair (+2), Shoot Fair (+2), Will Average (+1)
> Stress: [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]
> Attack at Great (+4) with teamwork. Each stress removes one soldier.

#### Hitters

Hitters deal damage and can take a few hits before going down. They're the dangerous combatants that make fights threatening.

**Building Hitters:**
- High concept and one other aspect
- Peak skill at Good (+3) or Great (+4)
- 2-3 supporting skills
- Stress track (2-3 boxes)
- One consequence (mild or moderate)
- Optional: One stunt that makes them distinctive

**When to use:** Assassins, elite guards, dangerous monsters, anyone who should make the party sweat.

> **Example: House Deneith Blademark**
> *Professional Mercenary*
> *Honor in Service*
> Skills: Fight Great (+4), Athletics Good (+3), Notice Fair (+2), Physique Fair (+2)
> Stunt: **Shield Wall**—+2 to defense when fighting alongside allies
> Stress: [ ] [ ] [ ]
> Consequence: Moderate [ ]

#### Bosses

Bosses are major antagonists who can threaten the whole party. They should feel like they could be player characters—or more.

**Building Bosses:**
- Full five aspects
- Skills in a pyramid (peak at Superb +5 or higher for truly legendary foes)
- Multiple stunts
- Full stress track
- Full consequence slots
- **Boss Features** (pick 1-3):
  - *Extra Actions*: Acts twice per exchange, or once per PC
  - *Damage Absorption*: Requires multiple stress boxes to fill one box
  - *Zone Control*: Free invokes on aspects in their territory
  - *Lieutenants*: Brings hitters or fillers into the fight
  - *Recovery*: Clears a mild consequence at end of scene, or can flee to return later
  - *Special Weakness*: Takes extra stress from specific attacks (drives investigation)

**When to use:** Campaign villains, faction leaders, monsters that define an adventure.

> **Example: The Lord of Blades**
> *Warforged Prophet of Revolution*
> *Flesh Is Weakness*
> *The Mournland Is Our Homeland*
> *Built for War, Born to Lead*
> *No Compromise with the Breathers*
>
> Skills: Fight Fantastic (+6), Provoke Superb (+5), Will Superb (+5), Physique Great (+4), Lore Great (+4), Athletics Good (+3), Notice Good (+3)
>
> Stunts:
> - **Adamantine Blades**: Weapon:2 on Fight attacks
> - **Inspiring Presence**: Warforged allies get +2 to Will when they can see him
> - **Machine Perfection**: Immune to poison, disease, and fear
>
> Boss Features: Extra Actions (acts twice), Lieutenants (warforged hitters)
>
> Stress: [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]
> Consequences: Mild [ ] | Moderate [ ] | Severe [ ]

### Obstacles and Constraints

Not all opposition fights back. Obstacles and constraints create problems that must be overcome or worked around.

#### Obstacles

Things that block progress or threaten harm. They don't take actions—they just *are*.

**Blocks** must be overcome to proceed:
- Locked Cannith vault door (Burglary Great +4 to pick, Physique Legendary +8 to force)
- Magical ward (Lore Superb +5 to dispel, or find another way)
- Sheer cliff face (Athletics Good +3 to climb)

**Hazards** attack passively or on a trigger:
- Poison gas cloud (attacks Physique at Good +3 each exchange)
- Unstable floor (attacks Athletics at Fair +2 when you move through the zone)
- Fire spreading through the building (attacks Physique at +2, increasing by +1 each exchange)

**Distrations** demand attention or create consequences:
- Civilians in danger (ignore them and gain *Innocent Blood on Your Hands*)
- Evidence about to be destroyed (overcome Resources Good +3 to preserve it)
- Reinforcements arriving (deal with them or face fillers next exchange)

> **Example: Cannith Security Ward**
> *Glowing Sigils Pulse with Warning*
> To bypass: Lore Superb (+5) to dispel, or Burglary Great (+4) to find the physical component
> If triggered: Attacks everyone in zone at Great (+4) with lightning, then alerts House Cannith

#### Constraints

Constraints are situational aspects that limit options without being overcome directly. They shape the scene.

- *Crowded Marketplace*—collateral damage, witnesses everywhere
- *Diplomatic Immunity*—can't just arrest them
- *Eyes of the Twelve*—House agents are watching
- *No Magic Zone*—manifest zone suppresses arcane effects
- *Time is Running Out*—represented by a countdown

Constraints should be invokable by both sides and create interesting choices.

### Countdowns

Countdowns create urgency. Something bad happens when they complete.

**Building Countdowns:**
- Define what happens at zero
- Set the number of boxes (3-6 typically)
- Decide what advances the countdown:
  - *Time*: Advances each exchange or scene
  - *Action*: Advances when enemies act or succeed
  - *Failure*: Advances when PCs fail key rolls
  - *Neglect*: Advances when PCs ignore the threat

The countdown is visible to players. The tension comes from knowing what's coming.

> **Example: Ritual Completion**
> The Emerald Claw is raising a bone knight. When complete, the battle gets much harder.
> [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]
> Advances each exchange. PCs can spend actions to disrupt (overcome Lore Good +3 to remove a box).

> **Example: Airship Going Down**
> The elemental ring is damaged. When this fills, the ship crashes.
> [ ] [ ] [ ]
> Advances when: Taking hull damage, failed piloting checks, or each exchange after the second.
> PCs can repair (Crafts Good +3) to remove a box.

> **Example: Cover Blown**
> The party is infiltrating a Daask stronghold. When this fills, the alarm sounds.
> [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]
> Advances when: Failed Stealth or Deceive rolls, suspicious activity noticed, time passes.

### Eberron Adversary Categories

Different Eberron threats fill different adversary roles:

| Eberron Threat | Typical Role | Notes |
|----------------|--------------|-------|
| Daask street thugs | Threats | Dangerous in packs, fragile individually |
| Emerald Claw soldiers | Fillers | Trained and organized |
| House Deneith blademarks | Hitters | Professional, well-equipped |
| Karrnathi undead soldiers | Fillers/Hitters | Don't break, don't tire |
| Living spells | Hitters/Bosses | Aspects define their danger |
| Quori-possessed agents | Hitters | Deceptive, flee when host is defeated |
| Warforged soldiers (Lord of Blades) | Hitters | Fanatic, won't surrender |
| Daelkyr | Bosses | Reality-warping horrors |
| Dragon (Chamber agent) | Bosses | Ancient, cunning, playing long games |
| Overlord servant | Boss | Campaign-ending threat |

### Quick Build Reference

| Role | Aspects | Peak Skill | Stress | Consequences | Special |
|------|---------|------------|--------|--------------|---------|
| Threat | 1 | +1 to +2 | None | None | Taken out by any hit |
| Filler | 1 (group) | +2 to +3 | 1/member | None | Shared track |
| Hitter | 2 | +3 to +4 | 2-3 | Mild or Moderate | One stunt optional |
| Boss | 5 | +5 or higher | 4+ | Full set | Boss features |

## Compels in Eberron

Compels drive story and earn players fate points. Eberron's themes provide rich compel opportunities.

### War Compels

*Cyran Refugee* → "You recognize that merchant—he commanded the Brelish unit that sacked your hometown."

*Karrnathi Veteran* → "The Aundairian envoy sneers at your accent. Your hand moves to your sword."

*Warforged Soldier* → "The child screams and runs. 'Monster! War machine!' The crowd turns hostile."

### House Compels

*Heir to House Cannith* → "Your house contacts have found you—and they're not here to help. They're here to bring you back."

*Mark of Finding* → "The Tharashk prospectors recognize your mark. They insist you help them—family obligation."

### Intrigue Compels

*Trust No One* → "Your paranoia is right for once—but you've been so suspicious that no one believes your warning."

*I Know Everyone Who Matters* → "You recognize the assassin—she's the daughter of an old ally. Can you really turn her in?"

### Setting Compels

*Sharn Native* → "This is your home turf, which means you can't ignore the gang moving into your old neighborhood."

*Morgrave Scholar* → "The artifact they're selling is clearly stolen from Xen'drik. Your professional ethics demand you intervene."

## Scene Types

### Investigation Scenes

Eberron investigations often involve magical elements.

**Information Sources**:
- Speak with Dead (expensive, limited, may be compromised)
- Divination magic (blocked by wards, gives cryptic results)
- Dragonmark powers (House Medani detection, House Tharashk tracking)
- Mundane investigation enhanced by magic (detecting magical residue, identifying alchemical compounds)

**Complications**:
- Evidence has been magically altered
- Witnesses' memories have been modified
- The crime scene is warded against divination
- Someone else is investigating—and getting in the way

### Chase Scenes

Sharn's vertical layout makes chases dynamic.

**Zone Ideas for Sharn Chases**:
- Crowded market bridge
- Plunging through a garbage chute
- Leaping between towers
- Skycoach chase
- Industrial district catwalks
- Cogs machinery maze

**Chase Complications**:
- Magical hazards (industrial magic gone wrong)
- Bystanders in danger
- Vertical drops (fall damage or opportunities)
- Weather (Sharn's artificial climate can be disrupted)

### Social Scenes

Eberron social scenes involve navigating complex relationships.

**High Society**: Galas, house gatherings, noble courts. Aspects matter—being underdressed, inappropriate nationality, wrong house.

**Underworld**: Taverns, gambling dens, Daask territory. Different rules apply. Showing weakness is dangerous.

**Political**: Council meetings, treaty negotiations, church gatherings. Every word is parsed. Every alliance is temporary.

**Create Advantage** actions in social scenes should create aspects that can be invoked in later interactions or conflicts.

### Combat Scenes

Make fights dynamic and meaningful.

**Environmental Elements**:
- Magical lighting (everbright, continual flame—can be disrupted)
- Vertical space (multiple levels, falling hazards)
- Magical devices (control panels, arcane machinery)
- Unstable structures (war damage, ancient ruins)

**Stakes Beyond Survival**:
- Protect the witnesses
- Stop the ritual
- Catch them before they escape
- Don't destroy the evidence

## The Mourning

The Day of Mourning destroyed Cyre four years ago. No one knows why. This is the central mystery of Eberron—and you should have an answer (or several possible answers) in mind for your campaign.

**Possible Causes**:
- House Cannith experiment gone catastrophically wrong
- Overlord breaking free (briefly or partially)
- Accumulated magical weapons reached critical mass
- The Draconic Prophecy demanded it
- An attack from Dal Quor
- A piece of Xoriat bleeding through
- Something the Cyrans did to themselves (accidentally or deliberately)
- Something no mortal yet understands

**Using the Mourning**:
- The Mournland itself is an adventure location
- Cyran refugees are everywhere, providing hooks
- Fear of another Mourning motivates political action
- Artifacts from pre-Mourning Cyre are valuable
- The truth is a campaign-level prize

## Running Magic and Artifice

### When Players Use Narrative Magic

When a player describes their skill roll as magical, let them. The wizard using Lore to create an advantage might describe casting Detect Magic. The cleric using Will to defend might invoke divine protection.

The rule: magic describes *how*, not *what*. The skill determines what's mechanically possible. Magic just makes it look cool.

### When Players Research or Create

Brainstorms and inventions let players tackle problems creatively. Be generous with what they can attempt, but honest about difficulty and complications.

**Brainstorm Difficulty Guidelines**:
- 2 aspects: Straightforward magical problem
- 3 aspects: Complex working with multiple components
- 4+ aspects: Major undertaking, possibly dangerous

**Invention Complication Examples**:
- Requires rare materials (adventure hook)
- Draws unwanted attention
- Has unexpected side effects
- Only works under specific conditions
- Requires ongoing maintenance

### When Magic Goes Wrong

Magic failing should create story, not just penalties.

- Divination shows partial truths that mislead
- Summoning attracts something other than intended
- Wards alert the people they were supposed to hide from
- Healing has unforeseen consequences
- Illusions reveal truths the caster didn't know

## Appendix: Sharn Quick Reference

- Dragonmarked enclaves
- Government offices
- Expensive everything
- "Looking down on everyone"

### Middle Wards
- Working class, merchants

- Where adventure lives

### The Cogs
- Below everything
- Forges and foundries
- Warforged laborers
- Daask strongholds
- Some things should stay buried

### Getting Around
- Skycoaches (taxis)
- Lifts (elevators between wards)
- Bridges (connect towers)
- Flight (if you can manage it)
- Falling (always an option)

## Appendix: Quick Reference

A one-page cheat sheet for play.

### The Ladder

|-------|--------|
| +8 | Legendary |
| +6 | Fantastic |
| +5 | Superb |
| +4 | Great |
| +3 | Good |
| +2 | Fair |
| +1 | Average |
| +0 | Mediocre |
| -1 | Poor |
| -2 | Terrible |

### Rolling Dice

Roll 4 Fate dice (4dF). Each die shows +1, 0, or -1. Add your skill rating.

**Result = 4dF + Skill vs. Difficulty (or opposed roll)**

### The Four Outcomes

| Result | Outcome |
|--------|---------|
| Fail by 3+ | Fail, and things get worse |
| Fail by 1-2 | Fail, or succeed at serious cost |
| Tie (0) | Succeed at minor cost |
| Succeed by 1-2 | Succeed |
| Succeed by 3+ | Succeed with style |

### The Four Actions

| Action | Use For | On Success |
|--------|---------|------------|
| **Overcome** | Get past obstacles, achieve goals | You do it (with style: get a boost) |
| **Create Advantage** | Make aspects, find existing ones | Free invoke on aspect (with style: 2 free invokes) |
| **Attack** | Hurt someone | Deal shifts as stress (with style: +1 shift) |
| **Defend** | Stop attacks/advantages | You stop it (with style: get a boost) |

### Fate Points

**Spend to:**
- **Invoke** an aspect for +2 or reroll
- **Declare** a story detail
- **Refuse** a compel (costs 1)

**Earn by:**
- **Accepting compels** (+1 fate point)
- **Conceding** a conflict (+1, plus +1 per consequence)
- **Refresh** at session start

### Stress and Consequences

**Stress**: Absorb shifts equal to box value. Clears after scene.

| Physical | [ ]1 [ ]2 [ ]3 |
|----------|----------------|
| Mental | [ ]1 [ ]2 [ ]3 |

**Consequences**: Absorb shifts; create aspect that can be invoked against you.

| Type | Shifts | Recovery |
|------|--------|----------|
| Mild | 2 | One scene |
| Moderate | 4 | One session |
| Severe | 6 | One scenario |

**Taken Out**: Out of stress and consequences? You're taken out. Opponent decides your fate.

**Concede**: Give up before taken out. You choose how you exit, plus earn fate points.

### Quick Opposition Guidelines

| Difficulty | When to Use |
|------------|-------------|
| +0 to +2 | Routine tasks, mook opposition |
| +3 to +4 | Challenging, competent opposition |
| +5 to +6 | Hard, expert opposition |
| +7+ | Nearly impossible, legendary opposition |

### Magic in Brief

- **Narrative permission** comes from aspects and modes
- **Use the four actions** with magical flavor
- **Costs on ties/failures**: backfire, unwanted attention, collateral damage
- **Signature Spells** are stunts that follow normal stunt rules
