## The Pitch

The Last War has raged for a hundred years. It's not stopping.

Five nations that were once a single kingdom have been tearing each other apart for a century. Nobody alive remembers peace. Aundair, Breland, Karrnath, Thrane, Cyre—each one believes the throne of Galifar belongs to them, and none of them are willing to stop killing to settle the question.

The front lines shift with the seasons. In the cities behind those lines, spies and war profiteers work the angles. The dragonmarked houses sell weapons and healing to every side and get richer by the year. Warforged roll off the creation forges of House Cannith and march straight into the meat grinder.

There are no good guys. There's your side, and there's everyone else.

### System

Fate of Eberron: Fate Core rules adapted for the Eberron setting. Fate is a narrative RPG where your character's story matters more than their stat block. Eberron is a world that mixes fantasy with noir intrigue, magical technology, and moral ambiguity. Think Indiana Jones meets Casablanca with magic and warforged.

**The twist:** We're playing during the Last War, not after it. The war is still on. Your characters are living through it. (The other guides on this site describe the default timeline where the war has ended. In our campaign, it hasn't.)

### Campaign Structures

One big decision we'll make as a group: **who do you work for, and why?**

**National intelligence unit.** You all serve the same nation. Missions behind enemy lines, sabotage, extraction, assassination. Think Band of Brothers meets Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. Everyone has the same flag but maybe not the same reasons for fighting.

**Dragonmarked house operatives.** The houses are officially neutral—they sell to all sides. You work for a house protecting its interests across borders. One week you're in Breland, the next in Karrnath. You answer to the house, not to any crown. Good for a mixed-nationality party.

**Independent mercenary company.** You fight for whoever's paying. Loyalty is to each other, not to any nation. This opens up moral dilemmas: what jobs do you take? What lines won't you cross? What happens when two employers want opposite things?

**Neutral investigators.** Working under the auspices of House Medani, House Tharashk, or an independent agency. Someone has to solve crimes, find missing people, and chase down dangerous artifacts even while the world is at war. The war is the backdrop, not the mission—but it keeps getting in the way.

**War profiteers and smugglers.** You operate in the grey market, moving goods, people, and secrets across borders. An airship crew, a smuggling ring, a "logistics company" that doesn't ask questions. The war is your business opportunity and your biggest threat.

### Character Ideas

- A **warforged** fresh off the creation forge, built to fight a war they never asked for
- A **Cyran operative** watching their homeland get squeezed from every direction, desperate to turn the tide
- A **Dark Lantern** (Breland's secret service) running missions behind enemy lines
- A **Karrnathi officer** who commands undead soldiers and tells themselves it's necessary
- An **artificer** building weapons on deadline because the front needs them yesterday
- A **dragonmarked heir** trying to keep the house neutral while their homeland bleeds
- A **deserter** who walked away from the front and now lives in the cracks between nations
- A **field medic** from House Jorasco who's patched up soldiers from every nation and is tired of all of them
- A **war correspondent** from the Korranberg Chronicle, chasing stories that powerful people want buried
