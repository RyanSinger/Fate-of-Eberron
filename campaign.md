## The Pitch

The Last War has raged for over a hundred years. It's not stopping.

Five nations that were once a single kingdom have been tearing each other apart for over a century. Nobody alive remembers peace. Aundair, Breland, Karrnath, Thrane, Cyre—each one believes the throne of Galifar belongs to them, and none of them are willing to stop killing to settle the question.

The front lines shift with the seasons. In the cities behind those lines, spies and war profiteers work the angles. The dragonmarked houses sell weapons and healing to every side and get richer by the year. Warforged roll off the creation forges of House Cannith and march straight into the meat grinder.

There are no good guys. There's your side, and there's everyone else.

### The Timeline

In default Eberron, the Day of Mourning destroyed Cyre in 994 YK. The horror of it forced the Five Nations to sign the Treaty of Thronehold and end the war. That didn't happen here.

Our campaign follows from the events of *The Singing Beacon*, the previous campaign. That story ended with the party making a deal with the Daelkyr to unmake House Orien's teleportation network—the breach points that would have caused the Mourning. The cost: no cataclysm means no treaty. The war grinds on.

**What's different from default Eberron:**

- **No Day of Mourning.** Cyre was never destroyed. No Mournland. No dead-gray mist.
- **No Treaty of Thronehold.** The war continues past 998 YK. There is no peace.
- **Cyre still stands.** Battered, squeezed between hostile nations, but 2.3 million people are alive who wouldn't be otherwise. Metrol is a living city, not a ruin.
- **No Orien teleportation network.** House Orien's teleportation circles were never built. Long-distance travel relies on House Orien's caravan routes, House Lyrandar's airships and ships, and the lightning rail. This makes the continent feel bigger and borders harder to cross.
- **The war is exhausted, not over.** A century of fighting with no decisive victory and no shock terrible enough to force peace. Nations are bleeding out slowly. Morale is cracking. Desertion is up. But no one can stop, because stopping means admitting the last hundred years were for nothing.

The other guides on this site describe the default post-war timeline. Everything about factions, dragonmarked houses, peoples, and the setting still applies—the war just hasn't ended yet.

### System

Fate of Eberron: Fate Core rules adapted for the Eberron setting. Fate is a narrative RPG where your character's story matters more than their stat block. Eberron is a world that mixes fantasy with noir intrigue, magical technology, and moral ambiguity. Think Indiana Jones meets Casablanca with magic and warforged.

### Campaign Structures

One big decision we'll make as a group: **who do you work for, and why?**

**National intelligence unit.** You all serve the same nation. Missions behind enemy lines, sabotage, extraction, assassination. Think Band of Brothers meets Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. Everyone has the same flag but maybe not the same reasons for fighting.

**Dragonmarked house operatives.** The houses are officially neutral—they sell to all sides. You work for a house protecting its interests across borders. One week you're in Breland, the next in Karrnath. You answer to the house, not to any crown. Good for a mixed-nationality party. A variant: you work for **the Twelve**, the inter-house council that coordinates between all the dragonmarked houses. Your team is drawn from different houses, sent to handle problems that threaten dragonmarked interests as a whole. Nobody's house comes first on these jobs.

**Independent mercenary company.** You fight for whoever's paying. Loyalty is to each other, not to any nation. This opens up moral dilemmas: what jobs do you take? What lines won't you cross? What happens when two employers want opposite things?

**Neutral investigators.** Working under the auspices of House Medani, House Tharashk, or an independent agency. Someone has to solve crimes, find missing people, and chase down dangerous artifacts even while the world is at war. The war is the backdrop, not the mission—but it keeps getting in the way.

**War profiteers and smugglers.** You operate in the grey market, moving goods, people, and secrets across borders. An airship crew, a smuggling ring, a "logistics company" that doesn't ask questions. The war is your business opportunity and your biggest threat.

### Character Ideas

- A **warforged** fresh off the creation forge, built to fight a war they never asked for
- A **Cyran operative** watching their homeland get squeezed from every direction, desperate to turn the tide
- A **Dark Lantern** (Breland's secret service) running missions behind enemy lines
- A **Karrnathi officer** who commands undead soldiers and tells themselves it's necessary
- An **artificer** building weapons on deadline because the front needs them yesterday
- A **dragonmarked heir** trying to keep the house neutral while their homeland bleeds
- A **deserter** who walked away from the front and now lives in the cracks between nations
- A **field medic** from House Jorasco who's patched up soldiers from every nation and is tired of all of them
- A **war correspondent** from the Korranberg Chronicle, chasing stories that powerful people want buried
