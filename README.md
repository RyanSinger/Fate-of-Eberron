# Fate of Eberron

A Fate adaptation for the Eberron campaign setting.

## What's Here

This repository contains three documents for playing Fate in Eberron:

- **Eberron Setting Guide** (`docs/markdown/eberron-setting-guide.md`) — World lore, nations, factions, and setting information for GMs and players.

- **Player's Guide** (`docs/markdown/eberron-players-guide.md`) — Character creation using the mode system, skills, stunts, dragonmarks, and magic rules.

- **GM's Guide** (`docs/markdown/eberron-gm-guide.md`) — Running the game, adversaries, factions as characters, campaign frameworks, and Eberron-specific guidance.

## Design Foundations

Fate of Eberron is built on:

- **Fate Condensed** as the base system
- **Atomic Robo RPG** mode system for character creation
- **Atomic Robo** brainstorm and invention mechanics for magic and artifice
- **Fate Adversary Toolkit** principles for NPCs and opposition
