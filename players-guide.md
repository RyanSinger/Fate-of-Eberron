A guide to creating characters and playing in the world of Eberron using the Fate system.

This document works alongside the **Eberron Setting Guide** (for world lore) and the **GM's Guide** (for running the game). If you're new to Eberron, read the Setting Guide first.

## What Is Fate?

Fate is a tabletop roleplaying game that focuses on collaborative storytelling. If you've played other RPGs like D&D or Pathfinder, you'll find Fate familiar but different in some key ways:

**Characters are defined by who they are, not what they have.** Your character's aspects—short phrases describing who they are—matter more than equipment lists or spell slots. A *Cynical War Veteran* plays differently than a *Wide-Eyed Morgrave Scholar*, regardless of their skill ratings.

**The dice suggest outcomes; they don't dictate them.** When you roll, the result tells you whether you succeed, fail, or something in between—but you and the GM work together to decide what that looks like in the story.

**Players have narrative authority.** You can spend fate points to add details to the world, not just bonuses to rolls. If your aspect says you're *Connected to the Boromar Clan*, you can declare that you know a guy in this district.

**Failure is interesting, not punishing.** Bad rolls don't mean "nothing happens." They mean complications, twists, and costs. The story keeps moving.

To play, you'll need:
- **Fate dice** (four six-sided dice with +, −, and blank faces) or regular dice (1-2 = −, 3-4 = blank, 5-6 = +)
- **Fate points** (tokens, coins, or poker chips)
- **Index cards** for aspects
- **Character sheets**

## What You Need to Know

Eberron is a world of pulp adventure, noir intrigue, and magical technology. The Last War ended two years ago, leaving the continent of Khorvaire scarred and uneasy. Your character lives in this world of airships and ancient ruins, dragonmarked houses and political conspiracies.

The key things that make Eberron different:

- **Moral ambiguity**: There are no clear heroes and villains. Even the "good" organizations have dark secrets.
- **Wide magic**: Minor magic is everywhere—street lamps, message services, healing houses—but powerful magic is rare.
- **The Last War**: A century of conflict ended recently. Everyone has a relationship to it.
- **Action and intrigue**: Think Indiana Jones meets Casablanca, not Tolkien.

---

## Creating Your Character

Your character is defined by:

- **Aspects**: Phrases describing who you are (5 total)
- **Modes**: Bundles of skills reflecting your background (3 modes)
- **Stunts**: Special tricks or abilities (3 free, buy more with refresh)
- **Stress and Consequences**: How you absorb harm
- **Refresh**: Your baseline fate points (starts at 3)

### Step 1: High Concept and Trouble

Start with your **high concept**—a phrase that captures who your character fundamentally is.

> Examples: *Cynical Brelish War Veteran*, *Warforged Seeking Purpose*, *Morgrave Scholar with Xen'drik Fever*, *House Medani Inquisitive*

Then define your **trouble**—something that makes your life complicated.

> Examples: *The War Isn't Over for Me*, *I Trust Too Easily*, *Debts to House Cannith*, *Hunted by the Aurum*

### Step 2: Choose Three Modes

Modes are bundles of skills that reflect your background, training, and expertise. You pick any three modes and rate them:

- One at **Good (+3)**
- One at **Fair (+2)**
- One at **Average (+1)**

Each mode contains several skills. Your rating in a skill depends on:

1. The mode's rating (Good, Fair, or Average)
2. Whether you're **Trained** (+0), **Focused** (+1), or **Specialized** (+2) in that skill within the mode

You get **improvement points** to spend within each mode:
- **Good mode**: 3 points
- **Fair mode**: 2 points
- **Average mode**: 1 point

That's **6 points total** across your three modes.

Spend your points as follows:
- **Focused** costs 1 point (+1 to skill)
- **Specialized** costs 2 points (+2 to skill)
- **Trained** is free (+0 to skill)

All skills in a mode start as Trained. You can only have **one Specialized skill per mode**.

If a skill appears in multiple modes, it's **reinforced**—you take the highest rating and add +1 for each additional mode that contains it.

> **Example**: Kaela picks Soldier (Good), Criminal (Fair), and Cyran (Average).
>
> In Soldier mode (3 points), she makes Fight specialized (2 points) and Athletics focused (1 point).
>
> In Criminal mode (2 points), she makes Stealth focused (1 point) and Burglary focused (1 point).
>
> In Cyran mode (1 point), she makes Will focused (1 point).
>
> Fight appears only in Soldier at Good +3, plus Specialized +2 = Superb (+5), exactly at the cap.
>
> Athletics is in both Soldier and Criminal. Soldier gives Good +3 plus Focused +1 = +4. Criminal gives Fair +2 plus Trained +0 = +2. She takes the higher (+4) and adds +1 for reinforcement = Superb (+5), exactly at the cap.
>
> Her final Fight and Athletics are both Superb (+5).

**Skill Cap**: No skill can exceed Superb (+5) at character creation.

### The Modes

Modes are organized into three loose categories—**Origins**, **Backgrounds**, and **Callings**—but you can pick any three. A character could take three Origins, three Callings, or any mix.

### Creating Custom Modes

If no existing mode fits your concept, create your own.

**Step 1: Name and Concept**

Give your mode a name that captures its essence. A mode represents a coherent set of capabilities—what someone *is*, *was*, or *does*.

**Step 2: Choose 5 Skills**

Pick 5 skills that make sense for the mode. The skills should hang together thematically.

- Think about what someone with this mode would be good at
- Include at least one "active" skill (Fight, Shoot, Athletics) and one "social" or "mental" skill for breadth
- Avoid modes that are just "5 combat skills" or "5 social skills"—that's min-maxing, not a character concept

**Step 3: Add Flavor**

Write 2-3 suggested aspects and 2 suggested stunts that fit the mode. This helps communicate what the mode is about and gives players a starting point.

> **Example Custom Mode: Morgrave Scholar**
>
> You study ancient history and lost civilizations at Morgrave University.
>
> **Skills**: Contacts, Investigate, Lore, Notice, Resources
>
> *Suggested Aspects*: *Morgrave University Professor*, *I've Read About This*, *Academic Rivals Are the Worst*
>
> *Suggested Stunts*:
> - **Expedition Contacts**: Because I've funded digs across Xen'drik, I get +2 to Contacts when dealing with explorers or antiquarians.
> - **Appraise Artifact**: Because I know relics, I can use Lore instead of Resources to determine an artifact's value.

> **Example Custom Mode: Daask Enforcer**
>
> You work for the monstrous crime syndicate.
>
> **Skills**: Athletics, Fight, Provoke, Notice, Physique
>
> *Suggested Aspects*: *Droaam's Reach in Sharn*, *Fear Is a Tool*, *Monster Among Humans*
>
> *Suggested Stunts*:
> - **Monstrous Reputation**: Because Daask is feared, I get +2 to Provoke when intimidating through threat of violence.
> - **Droaam Tough**: Because I was raised among monsters, I can use Physique instead of Will to resist fear or intimidation.

**For GMs: Quick NPC Modes**

When building NPCs, you can create modes on the fly. A mode is just "5 skills that make sense together." Don't overthink it.

- **Sharn Watch Guard**: Athletics, Fight, Notice, Physique, Shoot
- **Boromar Smuggler**: Burglary, Contacts, Deceive, Notice, Stealth
- **Emerald Claw Knight**: Athletics, Fight, Lore, Physique, Will

---

## Step 3: Remaining Aspects

You have three more aspects to define:

- **Relationship**: A connection to another PC. Good relationships have built-in tension or imbalance.
- **Two Free Aspects**: Anything important about your character—beliefs, important items, connections, or history.

Consider aspects that tie you to Eberron's setting:

- Your relationship to the Last War
- Connections to organizations (dragonmarked houses, criminal syndicates, governments, religions)
- Important items or heirlooms
- Personal goals or secrets

> Examples: *My Sword Belonged to a Cyran Hero*, *The Boromar Clan Owes Me a Favor*, *I'm Looking for My Missing Brother*, *The Mourning Took Everything but My Rage*

---

## Step 4: Stunts

You get three free stunts. You may buy additional stunts by spending 1 refresh each (minimum 1 refresh).

Stunts follow two basic templates:

### Bonus Stunts

**Because I [describe something special about you], I get +2 when I use [skill] to [action] when [specific circumstance].**

> *Because I **served as a Brelish reconnaissance scout**, I get +2 when I use **Notice** to **create an advantage** when **observing enemy positions**.*

> *Because I **studied at Arcanix**, I get +2 when I use **Lore** to **overcome** when **identifying magical effects**.*

### Rule-Changing Stunts

**Because I [describe something special about you], I can [describe what you can do], but only [limitation].**

> *Because I **don't sleep**, I can **stay alert during long watches without penalty**, but only **when guarding something important**.*

> *Because I **have contacts in every tavern**, I can **use Contacts instead of Investigate** to **gather rumors**, but only **in urban settings**.*

### Sample Stunts

**Armor of Faith**: Because of my unwavering belief in the Silver Flame, I can use Will instead of Physique to determine my physical stress boxes.

**Deadly Sniper**: Because I trained as a Karrnathi sharpshooter, I get +2 to Shoot attacks when I have taken time to aim (spent an action to create an advantage first).

**Inquisitive's Eye**: Because I've investigated hundreds of crime scenes, I get +2 to Investigate when examining a location where violence occurred.

**Lightning Reflexes**: Because I have honed battlefield instincts, I can use Notice instead of Athletics to defend against surprise attacks.

**War Machine**: Because I am a warforged built for battle, once per session I can ignore a mild consequence from physical damage.

---

## Dragonmarks

![A dragonmarked heir displaying her mark]({{ '/images/dragonmarked-heir.png' | relative_url }})

If your character carries a dragonmark, you'll need:

1. **An aspect** naming the mark (e.g., *Heir to House Cannith's Mark of Making*)
2. **(Optional) Dragonmark stunts** from the list below

Having the dragonmark aspect grants narrative permission to use your mark's basic abilities—a Mark of Healing lets you stabilize the dying, a Mark of Passage lets you open magically sealed doors, etc. Stunts give you mechanical advantages.

**Animal Empathy**: Because of my Mark of Handling, I can use Rapport with animals as if they were people.

**Maker's Eye**: Because of my Mark of Making, I get +2 to Investigate when examining constructed objects to understand how they were made or what went wrong.

### Mark of Passage (House Orien)

*Basic Permission*: You can move with supernatural ease and open sealed passages.

**Swift Movement**: Because of my Mark of Passage, I can move two zones as a free action once per scene instead of one.

**Open the Way**: Because of my Mark of Passage, I can use Will to overcome magical barriers and locks that would normally require special keys or rituals.

### Mark of Scribing (House Sivis)

*Basic Permission*: You can comprehend any written language and send short messages over distance.

**Linguist**: Because of my Mark of Scribing, I can read any written language, even ancient or obscure ones.

**Sending**: Because of my Mark of Scribing, once per scene I can send a short message (25 words) to anyone I've met, regardless of distance.

### Mark of Sentinel (House Deneith)

*Basic Permission*: You can sense threats to those you protect.

**Bodyguard**: Because of my Mark of Sentinel, when an ally in my zone would take stress, I may take that stress instead.

**Danger Sense**: Because of my Mark of Sentinel, I get +2 to defend against ambushes and surprise attacks.

### Mark of Shadow (Houses Phiarlan and Thuranni)

*Basic Permission*: You can manipulate light and shadow and create minor illusions.

**Cloak of Shadows**: Because of my Mark of Shadow, I get +2 to Stealth when in dim light or darkness.

**Minor Illusion**: Because of my Mark of Shadow, I can create small, silent visual illusions without rolling. They don't fool close inspection but work for misdirection.

### Mark of Storm (House Lyrandar)

*Basic Permission*: You can sense and subtly influence weather.

**Wind's Favor**: Because of my Mark of Storm, I get +2 to Drive when piloting airships or sailing vessels.

**Call Lightning**: Because of my Mark of Storm, I can use Will to make a Shoot attack by calling down lightning, but only outdoors.

**Trapfinder**: Because of my Mark of Warding, I get +2 to Notice when detecting traps and wards.

**Secure the Area**: Because of my Mark of Warding, I can use Lore to create a magical ward advantage that provides +2 to defend against intrusion in one zone. The ward lasts until the scene ends.

---

## Magic and Artifice

Magic in Eberron is everywhere but powerful magic is rare. There are two ways to use magic in play:

### Narrative Magic

If you have an aspect that establishes magical ability—such as *Morgrave-Trained Wizard*, *Kalashtar Mindlink*, *Servant of the Silver Flame*, or a dragonmark—you can describe any skill roll as being accomplished through magic.

When you use Lore to create an advantage, you might describe it as casting a divination spell. When you use Will to defend, you might describe a magical shield. When you Attack with Fight, you might describe a flaming sword.

The mechanics don't change—you're still rolling the appropriate skill. Magic is the narrative "how," not a separate system.

**What Magic Can't Do**: Your magical description can't exceed what the skill normally allows. Rolling Lore doesn't let you attack (unless you have a stunt that permits it). Magic provides flavor and permission, not new capabilities.

### Brainstorms: Solving Magical Problems

When characters face a major magical challenge—breaking an ancient ward, deciphering a prophecy, counteracting a curse—the group can engage in a **brainstorm**.

Brainstorms are collaborative problem-solving scenes. They work as follows:

1. **The GM describes the problem** and sets the difficulty (the number of aspects needed to solve it, typically 2-4).

2. **Players take turns** suggesting approaches and rolling relevant skills (usually Lore or Investigate). Success creates a **solution aspect** that addresses part of the problem.

3. **Each aspect** represents a piece of the puzzle. Once enough aspects are created, the problem is solved.

4. **Failures** don't stop progress but create complications—unwanted attention, cost, or side effects.

> **Example**: The party needs to dispel a Gatekeeper ward to enter an ancient Dhakaani ruin.
>
> The GM sets difficulty at 3 aspects needed.
>
> Thalia (Scholar mode) rolls Lore: Success! She creates the aspect *Identified the Binding Runes*.
>
> Keth (Artificer mode) rolls Crafts: Success with style! He creates *Constructed a Resonance Key* with a free invoke.
>
> Mira (Priest mode) rolls Will: Failure. The GM describes that her attempt draws the attention of something below—but doesn't prevent progress.
>

### Invention: Creating Magical Items

Characters with the Artificer mode (or similar background) can create magical devices. The key principle: **you can't fail to make it**. You're a skilled artificer—of course you can build it. The question is what complications arise along the way.

**Step 1: Define the Invention**

Describe what you want to make and what it does. This becomes your invention's **function aspect** (e.g., *Sending Stone Linked to Korran*, *Docent with Dhakaani Military History*).

**Step 2: Determine Catches**

Every invention requires **catches**—complications that must be resolved before it's complete. The more powerful the invention, the more catches it has:

| Complexity | Catches | Examples |
|------------|---------|----------|
| Simple | 1 | Everbright lantern, simple tool |
| Useful | 2 | Sending stone, minor wand |
| Sophisticated | 3 | Docent, elemental weapon |
| Complex | 4 | Airship component, bound elemental |
| Masterwork | 5 | Creation forge item, major artifact |

Choose catches from this list:

- **Time**: It takes longer than expected—days become weeks, the situation worsens while you work
- **Materials**: You need something rare, expensive, or hard to acquire—getting it may be an adventure
- **Help**: You can't do it alone—you need an expert, a faction's resources, or specialized knowledge
- **Facility**: You need access to a specific workshop, laboratory, or creation forge
- **Attention**: The work attracts unwanted notice—rivals, authorities, or something worse
- **Flaw**: The invention has a weakness or cost (becomes a flaw aspect the GM can invoke)

**Step 3: Make the Roll**

Roll Crafts (or Lore for purely magical constructs) against Good (+3). The outcome determines who chooses the catches:

| Outcome | Who Chooses Catches |
|---------|---------------------|
| Fail | GM chooses all |
| Tie | GM and player alternate, GM first |
| Success | GM chooses one, player chooses the rest |
| Success with Style | Player chooses all |

**Step 4: Resolve the Catches**

Play out the catches as scenes or obstacles. Need rare materials? That's an acquisition scene or a trip to the Mournland. Need help from House Cannith? Time to negotiate. Attracted attention from the Aurum? They're going to complicate your life.

Once the catches are resolved, the invention is complete.

**Flaws**

If "Flaw" was chosen as a catch, the GM creates a **flaw aspect** for the invention—something like *Drains Quickly*, *Unstable When Wet*, or *Distinctive Magical Signature*. The GM can invoke this aspect against you.

> **Example**: Keth wants to build a *Docent*—a magical adviser that can be installed in a warforged. That's sophisticated (3 catches).
>
> Keth rolls Crafts at Good (+3) and gets +1, for a total of +4. Success! The GM chooses one catch, Keth chooses the other two.
>
> The GM chooses **Attention**—House Cannith notices someone working on docent technology outside their control. Keth chooses **Materials** (he needs a Khyber dragonshard) and **Time** (it'll take a week, not a day).
>
> After acquiring the dragonshard and dealing with a Cannith inquisitor who comes asking questions, Keth completes the Docent with the aspect *Repository of Dhakaani Military History*.

## Playing the Game

### The Ladder

Fate uses a ladder of adjectives and numbers to rate skills, difficulty, and results:

| Rating | Adjective |
|--------|-----------|
| +8 | Legendary |
| +7 | Epic |
| +6 | Fantastic |
| +5 | Superb |
| +4 | Great |
| +3 | Good |
| +2 | Fair |
| +1 | Average |
| +0 | Mediocre |
| -1 | Poor |
| -2 | Terrible |

Player characters typically have skills ranging from Mediocre (+0) to Superb (+5).

### Fiction First

Before you pick up dice, describe what your character is doing. Your aspects and the situation determine what's possible—then you choose the appropriate skill and action. The fiction comes first; the mechanics follow.

### Rolling Dice

When the outcome is uncertain, roll **4 Fate dice** (4dF). Each die shows +, −, or blank. Add the results to your skill rating.

<div class="fate-dice">
<img src="{{ '/images/icons/fate-die.svg' | relative_url }}" alt="Fate Die" class="fate-die-icon">

**Fate Dice**: The average roll is +0; the range is −4 to +4. Most rolls cluster around −1 to +1.
</div>

Compare your total to either:
- **Passive opposition**: A difficulty number set by the GM based on the situation
- **Active opposition**: An opponent's defensive roll

The difference between your roll and the opposition is measured in **shifts**.

### Four Outcomes

Every roll produces one of four outcomes:

- **Fail** (you rolled lower): You don't achieve your goal. The GM may offer success at a major cost, or introduce a complication.
- **Tie** (you rolled equal): Partial success, or success at a minor cost. You get what you want, but there's a catch.
- **Success** (you rolled 1-2 higher): You achieve your goal without complications.
- **Success with Style** (you rolled 3+ higher): You achieve your goal and get an additional benefit—often a boost or extra effect.

### The Four Actions

<div class="action-grid">

<div class="action">
<img src="{{ '/images/icons/overcome.svg' | relative_url }}" alt="Overcome" class="action-icon">

**Overcome**: Get past an obstacle—unlock a door, decipher a code, convince a guard, climb a wall.

- **Fail**: You don't succeed, or you succeed at a serious cost.
- **Tie**: You succeed at a minor cost or achieve a lesser goal.
- **Success**: You achieve your goal.
- **Success with Style**: You achieve your goal and gain a boost.
</div>

<div class="action">
<img src="{{ '/images/icons/create-advantage.svg' | relative_url }}" alt="Create an Advantage" class="action-icon">

**Create an Advantage**: Make the situation work for you by creating or discovering an aspect.

- **Fail**: You don't create the aspect, or you create it but an enemy gets the free invoke.
- **Tie**: You get a boost (temporary aspect, one free invoke, disappears after use).
- **Success**: You create a situation aspect with one free invoke.
- **Success with Style**: You create a situation aspect with two free invokes.
</div>

<div class="action">
<img src="{{ '/images/icons/attack.svg' | relative_url }}" alt="Attack" class="action-icon">

**Attack**: Harm an opponent physically or mentally.

- **Fail**: You don't hit, or your attack is ineffective.
- **Tie**: You don't hit, but you gain a boost.
- **Success**: You hit and deal shifts of stress equal to the difference.
- **Success with Style**: You hit and deal stress; you may reduce damage by 1 to also gain a boost.
</div>

<div class="action">
<img src="{{ '/images/icons/defend.svg' | relative_url }}" alt="Defend" class="action-icon">

**Defend**: Block an attack, resist an advantage being created against you, or oppose someone's overcome attempt. Defense is a reaction, not a turn action.

- **Fail**: You suffer the consequences of your opponent's success.
- **Tie**: Varies based on what your opponent was doing.
- **Success**: You avoid the attack or effect.
- **Success with Style**: You avoid it and gain a boost against your attacker.
</div>

</div>

#### Which Skills Attack and Defend?

| Type | Attack With | Defend With |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| Physical (melee) | Fight | Fight or Athletics |
| Physical (ranged) | Shoot | Athletics |
| Mental | Provoke | Will |

### Aspects and Fate Points

**Aspects** are phrases that describe something important about a character, location, or situation. They are always true—if you have the aspect *Warforged Veteran*, you're a warforged who fought in the Last War.

You start each session with fate points equal to your **refresh** (usually 3).

**Spend fate points to:**

- **Invoke an aspect** for +2 to your roll or a reroll. The aspect must be relevant. You can invoke multiple different aspects on a single roll, but you can't invoke the same aspect twice (unless using free invokes).
- **Hostile invoke**: You can invoke an opponent's aspects against them. Pay the fate point *to them*—they get to use it later.
- **Declare a story detail** based on an aspect. If you have *Sharn Street Smart*, you might declare you know a fence in this district.
- **Refuse a compel** (costs 1 fate point).

**The Bogus Rule**: Anyone at the table can challenge an invoke that seems like a stretch. If the group agrees it's bogus, pick a different aspect or don't invoke.

**Earn fate points when:**

- The GM **compels your aspect** to create complications for you. You can refuse by paying a fate point.
- Another player **invokes your aspect against you**.
- You **concede a conflict**.
- You **self-compel**—retroactively decide one of your aspects caused a problem. "Remember when I got drunk at that party? That's because I'm *Can't Resist a Challenge*."

**How Compels Work**

Compels create complications, not denials. A compel shouldn't stop you from acting—it should make acting more interesting or costly.

There are two types:
- **Event compels**: The world conspires against you. "Because you're *Wanted by House Tarkanan*, assassins show up right now."
- **Decision compels**: Your nature pushes you toward trouble. "Because you're *Loyal to a Fault*, you stay to help your cornered ally instead of escaping with the artifact."

The GM offers a fate point and describes the complication. You can accept (take the fate point, deal with the problem) or refuse (pay a fate point from your pool).

### Challenges

When the group faces a complicated situation that isn't a direct confrontation—like researching ancient texts, infiltrating a gala, or performing a complex ritual—use a **challenge**.

The GM identifies the obstacles and assigns a skill and difficulty to each. Different characters can tackle different obstacles. Successes and failures accumulate to determine the overall outcome.

> **Example**: The party needs to stop a Cult of the Dragon Below ritual. Theron attempts to disrupt the ritual chanting (Will vs. Great), Kira works to free the sacrificial victim (Burglary vs. Fair), and Vex holds off cultist reinforcements (Fight vs. Good). Their combined successes and failures shape how the scene resolves.

### Contests

When two or more sides race toward mutually exclusive goals without directly harming each other—a chase, a debate, a race to find a clue—use a **contest**.

Each exchange, both sides roll an appropriate skill as an overcome action. The higher result scores a victory; success with style scores two victories. First to three victories wins. Ties create a new situation aspect representing an unexpected twist—neither side scores.

**Creating Advantages in Contests**: Before your overcome roll, you can try to create an advantage. If you fail, choose: forfeit your overcome roll this exchange, or proceed but give your opponent a free invoke on the aspect you just created.

> **Example**: Kira chases a Tyrant assassin across Sharn's towers. Each exchange, both roll Athletics. Kira scores a victory, then the assassin scores one. Kira gets success with style (two victories)—she's at three, she catches them.

### Conflicts

When characters can and want to harm each other—a fight, a heated argument, a psychic duel—use a **conflict**.

#### Zones

Space is divided into **zones**—discrete areas like "the tavern common room," "the balcony," or "the street outside." Most scenes have 2–4 zones. You can interact with anything in your zone. Moving to an adjacent zone is free unless something impedes you; impeded movement requires an overcome roll.

#### Setting Up

The GM establishes:
- The zones and what's in them
- Situation aspects (environmental features like *Dim Lighting*, *Crowded Dance Floor*, *Fifty-Foot Drop*)
- Who's present and where

#### Turn Order

Fate uses **popcorn initiative**: the side with the advantage picks who goes first. After you act, you pick who goes next—from either side. Once everyone on your side has acted, you must pick someone from the other side. The last person in an exchange picks who starts the next exchange.

#### Each Turn

On your turn, you can:
- Take one action (overcome, create advantage, or attack)
- Move one zone (free if unimpeded)

Defending is a reaction—you can defend as many times as you're attacked.

#### Zone Attacks

To attack everyone in a zone, spend an invoke (a free invoke or fate point) instead of taking the +2 bonus. Roll once; every target defends individually.

> **Example**: Jak throws an alchemical bomb at three Daask thugs. He spends his free invoke on *Volatile Mixture* to hit the whole zone. He rolls Shoot and gets +4. The thugs defend with Athletics: +2, +1, +3. Jak deals 2, 3, and 1 stress respectively.

#### Teamwork

- **Combine skills**: The best character rolls; others with Average (+1) or better in the skill add +1 each (max bonus = lead character's skill rating).
- **Create advantages**: Set up aspects with free invokes your allies can use.
- **Invoke for allies**: Spend fate points to add +2 to someone else's roll.

#### Full Defense

Instead of taking an action on your turn, you can focus entirely on defense. Declare what you're defending against (melee attacks, ranged attacks, a specific opponent, etc.) and gain **+2 to all defend rolls** against that focus until your next turn.

If you don't make any defend rolls before your next turn, you gain a **boost** as compensation—you've positioned yourself advantageously.

> **Example**: Surrounded by Emerald Claw soldiers, Tira forgoes her attack and declares Full Defense against melee attacks. She gains +2 to all Fight defenses until her next turn. If somehow no one attacks her in melee, she gains a boost like *Perfect Guard Stance*.

### Stress and Consequences

When you take harm, absorb it with **stress** and **consequences**:

**Stress** represents near-misses and minor hits. You have two stress tracks—**physical** (3 boxes) and **mental** (3 boxes). Each box absorbs 1 shift; check as many as needed. Physical attacks hit the physical track; mental attacks (Provoke) hit the mental track. Stress clears at the end of the scene.

**Consequences** are lasting injuries represented as aspects:

| Type | Shifts Absorbed | Recovery |
|------|-----------------|----------|
| Mild | 2 | One scene after treatment |
| Moderate | 4 | One session after treatment |
| Severe | 6 | One scenario after treatment |
| Extreme | 8 | Permanently replaces an aspect |

The attacker gets one free invoke on any consequence they inflict.

#### Treatment and Recovery

Consequences require treatment before they can begin healing. Roll an appropriate skill (Lore for physical injuries, Empathy for mental ones) against:
- Mild: Fair (+2)
- Moderate: Great (+4)
- Severe: Fantastic (+6)

Self-treatment adds +2 to the difficulty. After successful treatment, the consequence begins recovery and can be renamed to reflect healing (e.g., *Broken Arm* becomes *Arm in a Sling*).

#### Taken Out

If you can't absorb all the shifts from an attack, you're **taken out**—removed from the scene. The attacker decides what happens to you: death, capture, forced retreat, humiliating defeat, or something worse.

The outcome must fit the conflict's stakes. Losing an argument doesn't mean death. Losing a back-alley brawl might mean waking up in a Sharn jail—or in a Daask hideout. Consider creative alternatives: knocked unconscious and dragged somewhere, forced to accept unfavorable terms, left for dead but rescued by a passerby.

Talk with your group about boundaries. Some groups don't allow character death without player consent. That's fine—establish these expectations before play.

#### Conceding

You can **concede** at any time *before* your opponent rolls—not after you see a bad result. You immediately exit the conflict on your terms. You lose, but you control how.

**Why concede?** You gain one fate point, plus one for each consequence you took. More importantly, you escape with something: knowledge of the enemy's plans, a chance to warn allies, or simply your life. A concession isn't just losing—it's a tactical retreat.

**How it works:** Declare you're conceding and describe your exit. "I throw a smoke bomb and flee into the lower city." The opposition can negotiate—"You escape, but they get the artifact"—but you still get something out of it.

### Equipment

Most equipment is handled narratively—if you have a sword, you can fight with it. If you're a Cannith artificer, you have tools.

For **signature gear** that's central to your character, take this stunt:

**Personal Hardware**: You have an iconic possession. Choose two benefits:
- +1 to a specific skill application (e.g., +1 to Fight when parrying)
- Weapon:2 (add 2 shifts to successful attacks)
- Armor:1 (reduce incoming physical stress by 1)
- Once per session, use the item to take a skill action you normally couldn't

Beyond these mechanical benefits, the item can do whatever makes sense narratively. A sending stone lets you communicate at distance. A glider cloak lets you fly short distances. No roll required unless it puts you at risk.

> **Example**: Jak's **Cannith Multi-Tool** gives him +1 to Crafts when repairing and lets him once per session use Crafts to pick a lock (normally Burglary).

You can take this stunt multiple times for different items.

### Spellcasting

Magic in Eberron is common—magewrights light lamps, Orien heirs teleport cargo, and wandslingers duel in Sharn's streets. For player characters, magic works through the same Fate mechanics as everything else.

#### Narrative Permission

Your aspects and modes determine what magic you can attempt. If you have the **Mage** or **Priest** mode, you have broad permission to attempt magic appropriate to your tradition. An *Aundairian War Mage* can hurl fire; a *Gatekeeper Druid* communes with nature spirits; a *Priest of the Silver Flame* channels divine power against darkness.

Characters without a magical mode can still use magic if they have an appropriate aspect—a *Cyran Refugee with a Stolen Wand* might manage a few tricks, but they're not a trained spellcaster.

#### Magic as Actions

Most spells are just the four actions with magical flavor:

**Create Advantage** is the workhorse of battlefield magic. Cast *Shield of Faith* to create an aspect you can invoke for defense. Conjure *Deeper Darkness* to hinder enemies. Summon a *Spectral Hound* as an aspect that can be invoked for tracking or intimidation. Roll Lore (arcane) or Will (divine) against a difficulty set by the GM.

**Overcome** handles magical problem-solving. Dispel a ward, break a curse, identify an enchantment, calm a hostile spirit. The skill depends on the approach—Lore for analytical magic, Will for force of personality or faith.

**Attack** with magic works like any attack—roll your skill, deal stress. Whether you're swinging a sword or hurling lightning, the mechanics are identical. Mages typically attack with Lore or Shoot (for ranged blasts); priests might use Will for divine wrath.

**Defend** can be magical when appropriate. A wizard might use Lore to defend against magical attacks. A priest might use Will to resist mental intrusion or possession.

#### Magical Costs

When magic fails or ties, the GM can introduce costs that reflect the unpredictable nature of magic:

**Minor costs** (ties):
- The spell draws unwanted attention (magical or mundane)
- It takes longer than expected—you act last next exchange
- A minor side effect occurs (lights flicker, temperature drops)
- You take 1-2 stress from the strain

**Major costs** (failures offered as success-at-cost):
- The spell works but affects more than intended—allies caught in the blast, innocents frightened
- Something notices your magic from across the planes
- The magic leaves a lingering aspect the GM can invoke against you (*Magical Signature Traced*)
- You take a consequence representing magical backlash (*Drained*, *Arcane Burnout*)

> **Example**: Theron attempts to magically unlock a Cannith vault (Overcome with Lore vs. Great +4). He rolls +2—a failure. The GM offers success at a cost: "You crack the ward, but House Cannith's security systems logged the intrusion. You have maybe ten minutes before response teams arrive."

#### Signature Spells

For magic your character uses reliably—their go-to spells—build them as stunts. These follow the standard stunt patterns: +2 in narrow circumstances, permission to do something new, or break a rule once per session.

**Burning Hands**: Because I specialize in evocation, I can attack everyone in my zone with Lore. I must spend a fate point or free invoke to target the whole zone instead of one target.

**Charm Person**: Because I weave enchantments, I get +2 to Deceive when using magic to make someone view me favorably. This doesn't work on targets who are actively hostile.

**Detect Magic**: Because I sense magical auras, I can use Lore instead of Notice to detect magical effects, items, and creatures—even if they're hidden or disguised.

**Healing Word**: Because I channel restorative power, once per scene I can roll Will vs. Fair (+2) to clear one ally's physical stress box. On success with style, also clear a mental stress box.

**Invisibility**: Because I've mastered illusion, I can use Lore to create *Invisible* on myself. While invisible, I get +2 to Stealth. The aspect ends when I attack or the scene ends.

**Fly**: Because I command the winds, once per scene I can grant myself or a willing target the ability to fly for the rest of the scene. While flying, ignore ground-based zone boundaries and obstacles.

**Arcane Shield**: Because I weave protective wards, once per scene I can reduce incoming physical stress by 2 after seeing the result of an attack against me.

**Thunderwave**: Because I command elemental air, once per session I can push everyone in my zone (except myself) to adjacent zones of my choice. Spend a fate point to use this again in the same session.

**Turn Undead**: Because the Silver Flame burns through me, I get +2 to Will when creating advantages against undead or fiends. On success with style, they must also move one zone away from me.

#### Ritual Magic

For complex magical workings—opening a portal to Thelanis, binding a demon, raising the dead—use a **challenge** or the **invention** rules. Big magic shouldn't be a single roll; it should be a scene (or several scenes) with multiple obstacles and potential complications.

> **Example**: The party needs to close a manifest zone that's bleeding aberrations into Sharn. The GM frames it as a challenge:
> - Contain the immediate threat (Fight vs. Good)
> - Identify the zone's resonance frequency (Lore vs. Great)
> - Channel enough power to seal it (Will vs. Great)
> - Complete the ritual before more creatures emerge (time pressure)
>
> Failures don't stop the ritual—they introduce complications. Maybe the seal is imperfect, or closing it draws attention from something in Xoriat.

### Advancement

A **session** is typically 3–4 hours of play. An **arc** spans roughly 3–5 sessions and resolves a major storyline.

#### Milestones (End of Session)

At the end of each session, you may choose one:

- Switch the ratings of two skills, or replace one Average (+1) skill with a different one
- Rewrite one stunt
- Purchase a new stunt by spending 1 refresh (minimum 1 refresh)
- Rewrite any aspect except your high concept
- Rename a mild consequence to begin recovery

#### Breakthroughs (End of Arc)

When a major story arc concludes, you may do one thing from the milestone list, plus:

- Rewrite your high concept if you want
- Start recovery on any consequence not yet recovering (rename it); clear any that were already renamed
- Increase one skill by +1

**Skill balance**: When you increase a skill, you may need to promote other skills first. You can't have more skills at a given rating than you have at the rating below it. You can bank skill increases to spend together later.

The GM may also grant:
- +1 refresh
- A second skill increase
