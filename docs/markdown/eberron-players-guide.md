# Fate of Eberron: Player's Guide

A guide to creating characters and playing in the world of Eberron using the Fate system.

This document works alongside the **Eberron Setting Guide** (for world lore) and the **GM's Guide** (for running the game). If you're new to Eberron, read the Setting Guide first.

---

## What You Need to Know

Eberron is a world of pulp adventure, noir intrigue, and magical technology. The Last War ended two years ago, leaving the continent of Khorvaire scarred and uneasy. Your character lives in this world of airships and ancient ruins, dragonmarked houses and political conspiracies.

The key things that make Eberron different:

- **Moral ambiguity**: There are no clear heroes and villains. Even the "good" organizations have dark secrets.
- **Wide magic**: Minor magic is everywhere—street lamps, message services, healing houses—but powerful magic is rare.
- **The Last War**: A century of conflict ended recently. Everyone has a relationship to it.
- **Action and intrigue**: Think Indiana Jones meets Casablanca, not Tolkien.

---

## Creating Your Character

Your character is defined by:

- **Aspects**: Phrases describing who you are (5 total)
- **Modes**: Bundles of skills reflecting your background (3 modes)
- **Stunts**: Special tricks or abilities (3 free, buy more with refresh)
- **Stress and Consequences**: How you absorb harm
- **Refresh**: Your baseline fate points (starts at 3)

### Step 1: High Concept and Trouble

Start with your **high concept**—a phrase that captures who your character fundamentally is.

> Examples: *Cynical Brelish War Veteran*, *Warforged Seeking Purpose*, *Morgrave Scholar with Xen'drik Fever*, *House Medani Inquisitive*

Then define your **trouble**—something that makes your life complicated.

> Examples: *The War Isn't Over for Me*, *I Trust Too Easily*, *Debts to House Cannith*, *Hunted by the Aurum*

### Step 2: Choose Three Modes

Modes are bundles of skills that reflect your background, training, and expertise. You pick any three modes and rate them:

- One at **Good (+3)**
- One at **Fair (+2)**
- One at **Average (+1)**

Each mode contains several skills. Your rating in a skill depends on:

1. The mode's rating (Good, Fair, or Average)
2. Whether you're **Trained** (+0), **Focused** (+1), or **Specialized** (+2) in that skill within the mode

You get **improvement points** to spend within each mode:
- **Good mode**: 3 points
- **Fair mode**: 2 points
- **Average mode**: 1 point

Spend your points as follows:
- **Focused** costs 1 point (+1 to skill)
- **Specialized** costs 2 points (+2 to skill)
- **Trained** is free (+0 to skill)

All skills in a mode start as Trained. You can only have **one Specialized skill per mode**.

If a skill appears in multiple modes, it's **reinforced**—you take the highest rating and add +1 for each additional mode that contains it.

> **Example**: Kaela picks Soldier (Good), Criminal (Fair), and Cyran (Average).
>
> In Soldier mode, she makes Fight specialized (+2) and Athletics and Physique focused (+1 each).
>
> In Criminal mode, she makes Stealth focused (+1) and Burglary focused (+1).
>
> In Cyran mode, she makes Lore focused (+1).
>
> Fight appears only in Soldier at Good +3, plus Specialized +2 = Great (+5). But that exceeds the +4 cap, so it's Great (+4).
>
> Athletics is in both Soldier and Criminal. Soldier gives Good +3 plus Focused +1 = +4. Criminal gives Fair +2 plus Trained +0 = +2. She takes the higher (+4) and adds +1 for reinforcement = Superb (+5). Again capped at Great (+4).
>
> Her final Fight and Athletics are both Great (+4).

**Skill Cap**: No skill can exceed Great (+4) at character creation.

### The Modes

Modes are organized into three loose categories—**Origins**, **Backgrounds**, and **Callings**—but you can pick any three. A character could take three Origins, three Callings, or any mix.

---

---

## Step 3: Remaining Aspects

You have three more aspects to define:

- **Relationship**: A connection to another PC. Good relationships have built-in tension or imbalance.
- **Two Free Aspects**: Anything important about your character—beliefs, important items, connections, or history.

Consider aspects that tie you to Eberron's setting:

- Your relationship to the Last War
- Connections to organizations (dragonmarked houses, criminal syndicates, governments, religions)
- Important items or heirlooms
- Personal goals or secrets

> Examples: *My Sword Belonged to a Cyran Hero*, *The Boromar Clan Owes Me a Favor*, *I'm Looking for My Missing Brother*, *The Mourning Took Everything but My Rage*

---

## Step 4: Stunts

You get three free stunts. You may buy additional stunts by spending 1 refresh each (minimum 1 refresh).

Stunts follow two basic templates:

### Bonus Stunts

**Because I [describe something special about you], I get +2 when I use [skill] to [action] when [specific circumstance].**

> *Because I **served as a Brelish reconnaissance scout**, I get +2 when I use **Notice** to **create an advantage** when **observing enemy positions**.*

> *Because I **studied at Arcanix**, I get +2 when I use **Lore** to **overcome** when **identifying magical effects**.*

### Rule-Changing Stunts

**Because I [describe something special about you], I can [describe what you can do], but only [limitation].**

> *Because I **don't sleep**, I can **stay alert during long watches without penalty**, but only **when guarding something important**.*

> *Because I **have contacts in every tavern**, I can **use Contacts instead of Investigate** to **gather rumors**, but only **in urban settings**.*

### Sample Stunts

**Armor of Faith**: Because of my unwavering belief in the Silver Flame, I can use Will instead of Physique to determine my physical stress boxes.

**Deadly Sniper**: Because I trained as a Karrnathi sharpshooter, I get +2 to Shoot attacks when I have taken time to aim (spent an action to create an advantage first).

**Inquisitive's Eye**: Because I've investigated hundreds of crime scenes, I get +2 to Investigate when examining a location where violence occurred.

**Lightning Reflexes**: Because I have honed battlefield instincts, I can use Notice instead of Athletics to defend against surprise attacks.

**War Machine**: Because I am a warforged built for battle, once per session I can ignore a mild consequence from physical damage.

---

## Dragonmarks

If your character carries a dragonmark, you'll need:

1. **An aspect** naming the mark (e.g., *Heir to House Cannith's Mark of Making*)
2. **(Optional) Dragonmark stunts** from the list below

Having the dragonmark aspect grants narrative permission to use your mark's basic abilities—a Mark of Healing lets you stabilize the dying, a Mark of Passage lets you open magically sealed doors, etc. Stunts give you mechanical advantages.

### Mark of Detection (House Medani)

*Basic Permission*: You can sense danger and magical threats intuitively.

**Sense Danger**: Because of my Mark of Detection, I get +2 to Notice when rolling to determine turn order in conflicts.

**Pierce Illusion**: Because of my Mark of Detection, I can use Notice instead of Will to defend against illusions and mental deception.

### Mark of Finding (House Tharashk)

*Basic Permission*: You can track anyone or anything and sense the presence of dragonshards.

**The Hunt**: Because of my Mark of Finding, I get +2 to Investigate when tracking a specific creature or person.

**Dragonshard Sense**: Because of my Mark of Finding, I can sense dragonshards within one zone. No roll required, but the GM determines what you learn.

### Mark of Handling (House Vadalis)

*Basic Permission*: You have an innate rapport with animals and can calm hostile beasts.

**Animal Empathy**: Because of my Mark of Handling, I can use Rapport with animals as if they were people.

**Magebred Companion**: Because of my Mark of Handling, I have a magebred animal companion. It's a Fair (+2) NPC with one Good (+3) skill relevant to its nature.

### Mark of Healing (House Jorasco)

*Basic Permission*: You can stabilize the dying and speed recovery.

**Healing Touch**: Because of my Mark of Healing, once per scene I can reduce another character's consequence by one step (severe → moderate, moderate → mild, mild → cleared).

**Diagnostic Insight**: Because of my Mark of Healing, I get +2 to Empathy when determining someone's physical or mental condition.

### Mark of Hospitality (House Ghallanda)

*Basic Permission*: You can create comfort—food, shelter, and safety—in any circumstance.

**Safe Haven**: Because of my Mark of Hospitality, once per session I can declare that we find a safe place to rest, even in dangerous territory.

**Perfect Host**: Because of my Mark of Hospitality, I get +2 to Rapport when welcoming someone as a guest.

### Mark of Making (House Cannith)

*Basic Permission*: You have an intuitive understanding of how things are made and can repair objects.

**Jury-Rig**: Because of my Mark of Making, I can use Crafts to create a temporary repair or device that lasts one scene, even without proper tools or materials.

**Maker's Eye**: Because of my Mark of Making, I get +2 to Investigate when examining constructed objects to understand how they were made or what went wrong.

### Mark of Passage (House Orien)

*Basic Permission*: You can move with supernatural ease and open sealed passages.

**Swift Movement**: Because of my Mark of Passage, I can move two zones as a free action once per scene instead of one.

**Open the Way**: Because of my Mark of Passage, I can use Will to overcome magical barriers and locks that would normally require special keys or rituals.

### Mark of Scribing (House Sivis)

*Basic Permission*: You can comprehend any written language and send short messages over distance.

**Linguist**: Because of my Mark of Scribing, I can read any written language, even ancient or obscure ones.

**Sending**: Because of my Mark of Scribing, once per scene I can send a short message (25 words) to anyone I've met, regardless of distance.

### Mark of Sentinel (House Deneith)

*Basic Permission*: You can sense threats to those you protect.

**Bodyguard**: Because of my Mark of Sentinel, when an ally in my zone would take stress, I may take that stress instead.

**Danger Sense**: Because of my Mark of Sentinel, I get +2 to defend against ambushes and surprise attacks.

### Mark of Shadow (Houses Phiarlan and Thuranni)

*Basic Permission*: You can manipulate light and shadow and create minor illusions.

**Cloak of Shadows**: Because of my Mark of Shadow, I get +2 to Stealth when in dim light or darkness.

**Minor Illusion**: Because of my Mark of Shadow, I can create small, silent visual illusions without rolling. They don't fool close inspection but work for misdirection.

### Mark of Storm (House Lyrandar)

*Basic Permission*: You can sense and subtly influence weather.

**Wind's Favor**: Because of my Mark of Storm, I get +2 to Drive when piloting airships or sailing vessels.

**Call Lightning**: Because of my Mark of Storm, once per session I can call down a lightning strike as a Shoot attack using Will, but only outdoors.

### Mark of Warding (House Kundarak)

*Basic Permission*: You can sense wards and traps and create minor protective barriers.

**Trapfinder**: Because of my Mark of Warding, I get +2 to Notice when detecting traps and wards.

**Secure the Area**: Because of my Mark of Warding, I can use Lore to create a magical ward advantage that provides +2 to defend against intrusion in one zone. The ward lasts until the scene ends.

---

## Magic and Artifice

Magic in Eberron is everywhere but powerful magic is rare. There are two ways to use magic in play:

### Narrative Magic

If you have an aspect that establishes magical ability—such as *Morgrave-Trained Wizard*, *Kalashtar Mindlink*, *Servant of the Silver Flame*, or a dragonmark—you can describe any skill roll as being accomplished through magic.

When you use Lore to create an advantage, you might describe it as casting a divination spell. When you use Will to defend, you might describe a magical shield. When you Attack with Fight, you might describe a flaming sword.

The mechanics don't change—you're still rolling the appropriate skill. Magic is the narrative "how," not a separate system.

**What Magic Can't Do**: Your magical description can't exceed what the skill normally allows. Rolling Lore doesn't let you attack (unless you have a stunt that permits it). Magic provides flavor and permission, not new capabilities.

### Brainstorms: Solving Magical Problems

When characters face a major magical challenge—breaking an ancient ward, deciphering a prophecy, counteracting a curse—the group can engage in a **brainstorm**.

Brainstorms are collaborative problem-solving scenes. They work as follows:

1. **The GM describes the problem** and sets the difficulty (the number of aspects needed to solve it, typically 2-4).

2. **Players take turns** suggesting approaches and rolling relevant skills (usually Lore, Academics, or Investigate). Success creates a **solution aspect** that addresses part of the problem.

3. **Each aspect** represents a piece of the puzzle. Once enough aspects are created, the problem is solved.

4. **Failures** don't stop progress but create complications—unwanted attention, cost, or side effects.

> **Example**: The party needs to dispel a Gatekeeper ward to enter an ancient Dhakaani ruin.
>
> The GM sets difficulty at 3 aspects needed.
>
> Thalia (Scholar mode) rolls Lore: Success! She creates the aspect *Identified the Binding Runes*.
>
> Keth (Artificer mode) rolls Crafts: Success with style! He creates *Constructed a Resonance Key* with a free invoke.
>
> Mira (Priest mode) rolls Will: Failure. The GM describes that her attempt draws the attention of something below—but doesn't prevent progress.
>
> Thalia tries again with Investigate: Success! She creates *Found the Ward's Weakness*.
>
> With three aspects, the ward falls. But something is now watching...

### Invention: Creating Magical Items

Characters with the Artificer mode (or similar background) can create magical devices using the invention rules.

**Step 1: Define the Invention**

Describe what you want to make. The GM assigns a difficulty based on ambition:

| Difficulty | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| Average (+1) | Simple tool with one function |
| Fair (+2) | Useful device, common magic |
| Good (+3) | Sophisticated device, uncommon effect |
| Great (+4) | Complex creation, rare magic |
| Superb (+5) | Masterwork, powerful effect |

**Step 2: Gather Resources**

You'll need:
- **Time**: Hours to days depending on complexity
- **Materials**: May require a Resources roll or acquisition scene
- **Workspace**: Forge, laboratory, or appropriate setting

**Step 3: Build It**

Roll Crafts (or Lore for purely magical constructs) against the difficulty.

- **Success**: You create the item. It works as intended.
- **Success with Style**: As success, plus the item has an additional minor benefit (extra invoke, longer duration, etc.)
- **Tie**: You create the item, but choose one: it has a **flaw** (a negative aspect the GM can invoke), it's **temporary** (lasts only one session), or it requires a **cost** (materials, favors, time).
- **Failure**: The item doesn't work. You understand why and can try again with different approach, or accept a flaw and keep it anyway.

**Invention Aspects**

Inventions are treated as situation aspects or extras with aspects. A successful invention typically has:

- A **function aspect** describing what it does (*Sending Stone Linked to Korran*, *Everbright Lantern*)
- Optionally, a **flaw aspect** if created with compromise (*Drains Quickly*, *Only Works in Sharn*)

The invention can be invoked when relevant. Permanent items may cost refresh (GM's discretion for powerful effects).

> **Example**: Keth wants to build a *Docent*—a magical adviser that can be installed in a warforged.
>
> The GM sets difficulty at Great (+4) since it's complex magic.
>
> Keth has Crafts at Good (+3). He rolls and gets +2, for a total of +5. Success!
>
> The Docent has the aspect *Repository of Dhakaani Military History*. Keth can invoke this when the knowledge would help.

## Playing the Game

### Aspects and Fate Points

You start each session with fate points equal to your refresh (usually 3). Spend fate points to:

- **Invoke an aspect** for +2 or a reroll
- **Declare a story detail** based on an aspect
- **Refuse a compel** (costs 1 fate point)

Earn fate points when:

- The GM **compels your aspect** to create complications
- Another player **invokes your aspect against you**
- You **concede a conflict**

### The Four Actions

- **Overcome**: Get past an obstacle
- **Create an Advantage**: Create or discover an aspect
- **Attack**: Harm someone
- **Defend**: Avoid attacks or advantages

### Stress and Consequences

When you take harm, check stress boxes or take consequences:

- **Stress**: 3 boxes (1 point each). Clears after scene.
- **Mild Consequence** (2 shifts): Clears after one scene of rest
- **Moderate Consequence** (4 shifts): Clears after one session
- **Severe Consequence** (6 shifts): Clears after one scenario
- **Extreme Consequence** (8 shifts): Permanent aspect change

If you can't absorb the harm, you're **taken out**—the attacker decides what happens.

You can always **concede** before being taken out. You lose, but on your terms, and earn a fate point.
