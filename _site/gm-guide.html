    <p>A guide to running Eberron campaigns using the Fate system.</p>

<p>This document works alongside the <strong>Eberron Setting Guide</strong> (for world lore) and the <strong>Player’s Guide</strong> (for character creation).</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="running-eberron">Running Eberron</h2>

<p>Eberron has a distinctive tone that sets it apart from traditional fantasy. Your job as GM is to embody that tone in play.</p>

<h3 id="the-core-principles">The Core Principles</h3>

<p><strong>Everything Is Morally Complicated</strong></p>

<p>There are no pure heroes or irredeemable villains in Eberron. The Silver Flame church genuinely fights evil—and also conducted a purge that nearly wiped out lycanthropes and shifters. House Cannith created the warforged, giving rise to a new form of life—and did so to profit from a century of war. The Lord of Blades may be a terrorist, or may be the only one fighting for warforged liberation.</p>

<p>When you create NPCs, give them understandable motivations. When you present factions, show their virtues alongside their flaws. When players make choices, let those choices have real consequences—but not simple ones.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Don’t tell the players that the Church of the Silver Flame is good or evil. Show them a Thrane priest who heals the sick for free—and then show them another who treats shifters with barely concealed disgust. Let players form their own opinions.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>The War Isn’t Over</strong></p>

<p>The Last War ended with the Treaty of Thronehold, but a hundred years of conflict don’t just evaporate. Every adult in Khorvaire remembers the war. Many fought in it. Refugees from Cyre have no home to return to. Veterans carry physical and mental scars. The nations watch each other across borders, waiting for the next betrayal.</p>

<p>Use the war as background texture constantly:</p>
<ul>
  <li>NPCs mention relatives lost in the war</li>
  <li>Buildings bear damage from battles fought years ago</li>
  <li>Political tensions flare when characters of different nationalities interact</li>
  <li>Warforged face discrimination from those who see them as weapons, not people</li>
  <li>Cyran refugees are everywhere, stateless and bitter</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Intrigue and Conspiracy</strong></p>

<p>Nothing in Eberron is what it seems on the surface. Every organization has secrets. Every powerful figure has hidden agendas. Conspiracies nest inside conspiracies.</p>

<p>The Aurum manipulates commerce and politics. The Dreaming Dark infiltrates through dreams. The Lords of Dust have plans spanning millennia. The Chamber’s dragons pursue the Draconic Prophecy through proxies. The dragonmarked houses pursue their own interests across national borders.</p>

<p>Build layers into your mysteries. When players solve one conspiracy, they should glimpse another beneath it. Not everything needs an answer—some mysteries should remain mysteries.</p>

<p><strong>Cinematic Action</strong></p>

<p>Eberron is pulp adventure, not gritty realism. Fights happen on lightning rails racing through the Mournland. Chases unfold across Sharn’s vertical cityscape. Ancient ruins contain elaborate traps and awakening horrors.</p>

<p>Push for dynamic locations and dramatic situations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>“You’re fighting on a rain-slick bridge between two towers, five hundred feet above Lower Dura.”</li>
  <li>“The train lurches as something massive strikes it from beneath the track.”</li>
  <li>“The ritual circle flares with light. You have until the moons align—maybe five minutes.”</li>
</ul>

<p>Use zones aggressively. Create environmental hazards. Let players destroy the scenery. Embrace the chaos.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="building-adversaries">Building Adversaries</h2>

<p>The Fate Adversary Toolkit provides a framework for building opposition based on narrative role rather than power level. Choose adversary types based on the story function you need.</p>

<h3 id="adversary-types">Adversary Types</h3>

<h4 id="threats">Threats</h4>

<p>Threats exist to be hit once and go down. They’re dangerous in numbers but not individually durable. Use them to create chaos and drain resources.</p>

<p><strong>Building Threats:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>One aspect (their concept: <em>Daask Street Thug</em>, <em>Emerald Claw Initiate</em>)</li>
  <li>One or two skills at Average (+1) or Fair (+2)</li>
  <li>No stress track—any successful hit takes them out</li>
  <li>Attack in groups using teamwork (+1 per additional threat, max +3)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>When to use:</strong> Swarms of enemies, dangerous-but-fragile minions, time pressure through numbers.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Example: Boromar Thugs</strong>
<em>Halfling Street Muscle</em>
Skills: Fight Average (+1), Notice Average (+1)
A group of 4 attacks at Fair (+2). Each hit removes one thug.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="fillers">Fillers</h4>

<p>Fillers are grouped enemies that share a stress track. They’re tougher than threats but still exist to be mowed down.</p>

<p><strong>Building Fillers:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>One aspect for the group</li>
  <li>One or two skills at Fair (+2) or Good (+3)</li>
  <li>Shared stress track (1 box per member)</li>
  <li>Attack as one unit with teamwork bonus</li>
  <li>Removing stress removes individuals from the fight</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>When to use:</strong> Guards, cultists, mercenary squads—opposition that should feel substantial but not individually memorable.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Example: Emerald Claw Squad (4 soldiers)</strong>
<em>Vol’s Faithful Servants</em>
Skills: Fight Fair (+2), Shoot Fair (+2), Will Average (+1)
Stress: [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]
Attack at Great (+4) with teamwork. Each stress removes one soldier.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="hitters">Hitters</h4>

<p>Hitters deal damage and can take a few hits before going down. They’re the dangerous combatants that make fights threatening.</p>

<p><strong>Building Hitters:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>High concept and one other aspect</li>
  <li>Peak skill at Good (+3) or Great (+4)</li>
  <li>2-3 supporting skills</li>
  <li>Stress track (2-3 boxes)</li>
  <li>One consequence (mild or moderate)</li>
  <li>Optional: One stunt that makes them distinctive</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>When to use:</strong> Assassins, elite guards, dangerous monsters, anyone who should make the party sweat.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Example: House Deneith Blademark</strong>
<em>Professional Mercenary</em>
<em>Honor in Service</em>
Skills: Fight Great (+4), Athletics Good (+3), Notice Fair (+2), Physique Fair (+2)
Stunt: <strong>Shield Wall</strong>—+2 to defense when fighting alongside allies
Stress: [ ] [ ] [ ]
Consequence: Moderate [ ]</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="bosses">Bosses</h4>

<p>Bosses are major antagonists who can threaten the whole party. They should feel like they could be player characters—or more.</p>

<p><strong>Building Bosses:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Full five aspects</li>
  <li>Skills in a pyramid (peak at Superb +5 or higher for truly legendary foes)</li>
  <li>Multiple stunts</li>
  <li>Full stress track</li>
  <li>Full consequence slots</li>
  <li><strong>Boss Features</strong> (pick 1-3):
    <ul>
      <li><em>Extra Actions</em>: Acts twice per exchange, or once per PC</li>
      <li><em>Damage Absorption</em>: Requires multiple stress boxes to fill one box</li>
      <li><em>Zone Control</em>: Free invokes on aspects in their territory</li>
      <li><em>Lieutenants</em>: Brings hitters or fillers into the fight</li>
      <li><em>Recovery</em>: Clears a mild consequence at end of scene, or can flee to return later</li>
      <li><em>Special Weakness</em>: Takes extra stress from specific attacks (drives investigation)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>When to use:</strong> Campaign villains, faction leaders, monsters that define an adventure.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Example: The Lord of Blades</strong>
<em>Warforged Prophet of Revolution</em>
<em>Flesh Is Weakness</em>
<em>The Mournland Is Our Homeland</em>
<em>Built for War, Born to Lead</em>
<em>No Compromise with the Breathers</em></p>

  <p>Skills: Fight Fantastic (+6), Provoke Superb (+5), Will Superb (+5), Physique Great (+4), Lore Great (+4), Athletics Good (+3), Notice Good (+3)</p>

  <p>Stunts:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Adamantine Blades</strong>: Weapon:2 on Fight attacks</li>
    <li><strong>Inspiring Presence</strong>: Warforged allies get +2 to Will when they can see him</li>
    <li><strong>Machine Perfection</strong>: Immune to poison, disease, and fear</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Boss Features: Extra Actions (acts twice), Lieutenants (warforged hitters)</p>

  <p>Stress: [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]
Consequences: Mild [ ] | Moderate [ ] | Severe [ ]</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="obstacles-and-constraints">Obstacles and Constraints</h3>

<p>Not all opposition fights back. Obstacles and constraints create problems that must be overcome or worked around.</p>

<h4 id="obstacles">Obstacles</h4>

<p>Things that block progress or threaten harm. They don’t take actions—they just <em>are</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Blocks</strong> must be overcome to proceed:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Locked Cannith vault door (Burglary Great +4 to pick, Physique Legendary +8 to force)</li>
  <li>Magical ward (Lore Superb +5 to dispel, or find another way)</li>
  <li>Sheer cliff face (Athletics Good +3 to climb)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Hazards</strong> attack passively or on a trigger:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Poison gas cloud (attacks Physique at Good +3 each exchange)</li>
  <li>Unstable floor (attacks Athletics at Fair +2 when you move through the zone)</li>
  <li>Fire spreading through the building (attacks Physique at +2, increasing by +1 each exchange)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Distrations</strong> demand attention or create consequences:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Civilians in danger (ignore them and gain <em>Innocent Blood on Your Hands</em>)</li>
  <li>Evidence about to be destroyed (overcome Resources Good +3 to preserve it)</li>
  <li>Reinforcements arriving (deal with them or face fillers next exchange)</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Example: Cannith Security Ward</strong>
<em>Glowing Sigils Pulse with Warning</em>
To bypass: Lore Superb (+5) to dispel, or Burglary Great (+4) to find the physical component
If triggered: Attacks everyone in zone at Great (+4) with lightning, then alerts House Cannith</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="constraints">Constraints</h4>

<p>Constraints are situational aspects that limit options without being overcome directly. They shape the scene.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Crowded Marketplace</em>—collateral damage, witnesses everywhere</li>
  <li><em>Diplomatic Immunity</em>—can’t just arrest them</li>
  <li><em>Eyes of the Twelve</em>—House agents are watching</li>
  <li><em>No Magic Zone</em>—manifest zone suppresses arcane effects</li>
  <li><em>Time is Running Out</em>—represented by a countdown</li>
</ul>

<p>Constraints should be invokable by both sides and create interesting choices.</p>

<h3 id="countdowns">Countdowns</h3>

<p>Countdowns create urgency. Something bad happens when they complete.</p>

<p><strong>Building Countdowns:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Define what happens at zero</li>
  <li>Set the number of boxes (3-6 typically)</li>
  <li>Decide what advances the countdown:
    <ul>
      <li><em>Time</em>: Advances each exchange or scene</li>
      <li><em>Action</em>: Advances when enemies act or succeed</li>
      <li><em>Failure</em>: Advances when PCs fail key rolls</li>
      <li><em>Neglect</em>: Advances when PCs ignore the threat</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The countdown is visible to players. The tension comes from knowing what’s coming.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Example: Ritual Completion</strong>
The Emerald Claw is raising a bone knight. When complete, the battle gets much harder.
[ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]
Advances each exchange. PCs can spend actions to disrupt (overcome Lore Good +3 to remove a box).</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Example: Airship Going Down</strong>
The elemental ring is damaged. When this fills, the ship crashes.
[ ] [ ] [ ]
Advances when: Taking hull damage, failed piloting checks, or each exchange after the second.
PCs can repair (Crafts Good +3) to remove a box.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Example: Cover Blown</strong>
The party is infiltrating a Daask stronghold. When this fills, the alarm sounds.
[ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]
Advances when: Failed Stealth or Deceive rolls, suspicious activity noticed, time passes.</p>

<h2 id="scene-types">Scene Types</h2>

<h3 id="investigation-scenes">Investigation Scenes</h3>

<p>Eberron investigations often involve magical elements.</p>

<p><strong>Information Sources</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Speak with Dead (expensive, limited, may be compromised)</li>
  <li>Divination magic (blocked by wards, gives cryptic results)</li>
  <li>Dragonmark powers (House Medani detection, House Tharashk tracking)</li>
  <li>Mundane investigation enhanced by magic (detecting magical residue, identifying alchemical compounds)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Complications</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Evidence has been magically altered</li>
  <li>Witnesses’ memories have been modified</li>
  <li>The crime scene is warded against divination</li>
  <li>Someone else is investigating—and getting in the way</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="chase-scenes">Chase Scenes</h3>

<p>Sharn’s vertical layout makes chases dynamic.</p>

<p><strong>Zone Ideas for Sharn Chases</strong>:</p>

  <li>Crowded market bridge</li>
  <li>Plunging through a garbage chute</li>
  <li>Leaping between towers</li>
  <li>Skycoach chase</li>

  <li>Cogs machinery maze</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Chase Complications</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Magical hazards (industrial magic gone wrong)</li>
  <li>Bystanders in danger</li>
  <li>Vertical drops (fall damage or opportunities)</li>
  <li>Weather (Sharn’s artificial climate can be disrupted)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="social-scenes">Social Scenes</h3>

<p>Eberron social scenes involve navigating complex relationships.</p>

<p><strong>High Society</strong>: Galas, house gatherings, noble courts. Aspects matter—being underdressed, inappropriate nationality, wrong house.</p>

<p><strong>Underworld</strong>: Taverns, gambling dens, Daask territory. Different rules apply. Showing weakness is dangerous.</p>

<p><strong>Political</strong>: Council meetings, treaty negotiations, church gatherings. Every word is parsed. Every alliance is temporary.</p>

<p><strong>Create Advantage</strong> actions in social scenes should create aspects that can be invoked in later interactions or conflicts.</p>

<h3 id="combat-scenes">Combat Scenes</h3>

<p>Make fights dynamic and meaningful.</p>

<p><strong>Environmental Elements</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Magical lighting (everbright, continual flame—can be disrupted)</li>
  <li>Vertical space (multiple levels, falling hazards)</li>
  <li>Magical devices (control panels, arcane machinery)</li>
  <li>Unstable structures (war damage, ancient ruins)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Stakes Beyond Survival</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Protect the witnesses</li>
  <li>Stop the ritual</li>
  <li>Catch them before they escape</li>
  <li>Don’t destroy the evidence</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-mourning">The Mourning</h2>

<p>The Day of Mourning destroyed Cyre four years ago. No one knows why. This is the central mystery of Eberron—and you should have an answer (or several possible answers) in mind for your campaign.</p>

<p><strong>Possible Causes</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>House Cannith experiment gone catastrophically wrong</li>
  <li>Overlord breaking free (briefly or partially)</li>
  <li>Accumulated magical weapons reached critical mass</li>
  <li>The Draconic Prophecy demanded it</li>
  <li>An attack from Dal Quor</li>
  <li>A piece of Xoriat bleeding through</li>
  <li>Something the Cyrans did to themselves (accidentally or deliberately)</li>
  <li>Something no mortal yet understands</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Using the Mourning</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Mournland itself is an adventure location</li>
  <li>Cyran refugees are everywhere, providing hooks</li>
  <li>Fear of another Mourning motivates political action</li>
  <li>Artifacts from pre-Mourning Cyre are valuable</li>
  <li>The truth is a campaign-level prize</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="running-magic-and-artifice">Running Magic and Artifice</h2>

<h3 id="when-players-use-narrative-magic">When Players Use Narrative Magic</h3>

<p>When a player describes their skill roll as magical, let them. The wizard using Lore to create an advantage might describe casting Detect Magic. The cleric using Will to defend might invoke divine protection.</p>

<p>The rule: magic describes <em>how</em>, not <em>what</em>. The skill determines what’s mechanically possible. Magic just makes it look cool.</p>

<h3 id="when-players-research-or-create">When Players Research or Create</h3>

<p>Brainstorms and inventions let players tackle problems creatively. Be generous with what they can attempt, but honest about difficulty and complications.</p>

<p><strong>Brainstorm Difficulty Guidelines</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>2 aspects: Straightforward magical problem</li>
  <li>3 aspects: Complex working with multiple components</li>
  <li>4+ aspects: Major undertaking, possibly dangerous</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Invention Complication Examples</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Requires rare materials (adventure hook)</li>
  <li>Draws unwanted attention</li>
  <li>Has unexpected side effects</li>
  <li>Only works under specific conditions</li>
  <li>Requires ongoing maintenance</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="when-magic-goes-wrong">When Magic Goes Wrong</h3>

<p>Magic failing should create story, not just penalties.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Divination shows partial truths that mislead</li>
  <li>Summoning attracts something other than intended</li>
  <li>Wards alert the people they were supposed to hide from</li>
  <li>Healing has unforeseen consequences</li>
  <li>Illusions reveal truths the caster didn’t know</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="appendix-sharn-quick-reference">Appendix: Sharn Quick Reference</h2>
